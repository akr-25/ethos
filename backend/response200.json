      "text": "By Grace Cyril: The January 2 episode of Bigg Boss 16 was all about surprise nominations as contestants shocked everyone by nominating their friends. Nimrit Kaur Ahluwalia also shocked the housemates as she nominated her good friend Sajid Khan. This obviously upset the filmmaker. On the other hand, everyone questioned Shalin Bhanot and Tina Datta's relationship. This led to a fight between Shalin and Archana Gautam.\n\nHere's what happened on January 2 episode of BB 16:\n\n1. For the uninitiated, in the New Year episode, Shalin and Tina's romantic dance took the limelight. Everyone started discussing if their relationship is fake or not.\n\n2. Shalin tried to justify asking that if Archana and Soundarya share blankets, will they be called lesbians. This led to a huge argument in the BB house. Archana was upset that Shalin called her a lesbian while giving an example.\n\n3. Shalin had said that he and Tina are just friends. He also said if getting close means being in a relationship, then Archana and Soundarya could be lesbians too.\n\n4. Later, when Soundarya and Archana were discussing this with Nimrit, the latter said that Shalin is a cheap contestant. Nimrit said, \u201cYe har din or cheap Hota jaa raha hai.\u201d\n\n5. Archana remarked, \u201cIska beta school jaata hoga toh ussko log bolte hoga ke tera baap Bigg Boss me kya kar raha hai.\u201d However, Nimrit asked her not to make such comments as they are personal.\n\n6. Meanwhile, the nomination task took place in the BB house in the previous episode. Housemates had to nominate a contestant while giving a reason why they don't deserve to be in the house.\n\n7. Nimrit shocked everyone by nominating her good friend Sajid Khan. The filmmaker was obviously hurt, but he said that nominations do not affect him at all.\n\n8. Sajid Khan said, \u201cLog kehte hai me nominations ke baad thoda hil jaata hu but aisa bilkul nahi hai.. Muje nominations se bilkul farak nai padta.. jisko jo ukhadna hai ukhad lo.\u201d\n\n9. The nominees for the week are Tina, Sajid, Shalin, Soundarya, Archana, Sreejita and Sumbul.\n\n10. Meanwhile, Tina and Nimrit got into a verbal brawl over hygiene issues in the kitchen.\n\nMeanwhile, Bigg Boss 16 has gotten an extension after receiving high TRPs. Salman Khan's contract with the show for the season is coming to an end. As per reports, Karan Johar might replace him as a host for the remaining season.",

      "text": "KARACHI, 2 Jan: New Zealand slipped against Pakistan allrounder Agha Salman\u2019s offspin in the final session after Devon Conway hit his fourth test hundred on the opening day of the second test on Monday.\n\nNew Zealand was cruising along at 234-1 on the back of Conway\u2019s 122 off 191 balls before Salman picked up 3-55 and the Black Caps finished the day at 309-6.\n\nTom Blundell was not out on 30 while Ish Sodhi, who made a career-best 65 in the drawn first test, was unbeaten on 11.\n\nConway put on two solid century stands with Tom Latham (71) and Kane Williamson (36) in a dominating first two sessions for the Black Caps after Tim Southee won the toss and elected to bat before losing five wickets for 45 runs after tea.\n\n\u201cThe surface (pitch) certainly got a little bit drier which offered a little bit more spin for the turners,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThe game is certainly evenly poised, we did win those first two sessions, but the way Pakistan have bounced back in that last session certainly brought them back in the game.\u201d\n\nSalman pegged back New Zealand with the old ball on a wicket that had some grass and tempted Pakistan to go with three fast bowlers \u2014 Mir Hamza, recalled Hasan Ali and fit-again Naseem Shah \u2014 and just one specialist spinner Abrar Ahmed.\n\n\u201cI knew there could be a responsibility on me as a second spinner for which I was ready,\u201d Salman said. \u201cThe wicket had a bite (for spinners) after tea as it got dried up and it troubled them.\u201d\n\nSalman ignited the collapse when he found the outside edge of Conway\u2019s bat that ended his 100-run stand with Williamson. The offspinner, who bowled 12-over spell after tea, hit back the off stump of Daryl Mitchell (3) with his turning delivery before successfully overturning a caught behind decision through TV referral against Henry Nicholls (26).\n\nEarlier, Conway and Latham contributed a second successive century opening stand in the two-match series before Naseem Shah (2-44) brought the lone success in the first two sessions when he had Latham trapped leg before wicket of a full delivery after lunch but New Zealand added further 107 runs in the post-lunch session.\n\nNaseem was rewarded for his reverse swing when he also found the outside edge of Williamson\u2019s bat and was brilliantly snapped by diving Sarfaraz Ahmed in front of first slip soon after Salman had dismissed Conway.\n\nBoth lefthanders Conway and Latham dominated the pace and spin in the first session to produce 119 runs and even showed aggression against Abrar\u2019s mystery spin after captain Babar Azam turned to his ace spinner as early as in the ninth over.\n\nLeftarm fast bowler Hamza twice came close to gaining a breakthrough in his return spell before lunch, but first Latham successfully overturned onfield umpire Alex Wharf\u2019s lbw ruling and then Pakistan went for an unsuccessful leg before wicket TV referral against Conway before he also completed a half century.\n\nHasan Ali, playing his first test since July, twice found the edges of Conway\u2019s bat in successive overs after lunch only to see the ball fall short of Abdullah Shafique in the slips and then Saud Shakeel couldn\u2019t hold onto a sharp chance in gully while diving full length to his right when the lefthander was 11 shy of his hundred.\n\nConway completed his century off 156 balls with 13 fours and a six with a flick of Hamza to midwicket and ran three while Williamson also kept the bowlers at bay with his determined batting before Salman struck after tea.\n\n\u201cPersonally, it\u2019s been a good ride so far when you have played a handful of test games,\u201d Conway said after completing his fourth hundred in only his 12th test match. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to get an opportunity to play and contribute for the team.\u201d\n\nBoth Conway and Latham batters motored New Zealand to 63 inside the first hour and batted aggressively against fast bowlers Naseem Shah and Hasan Ali, who made comebacks to test cricket.\n\nConway raised New Zealand\u2019s half century with a six against the mystery spinner Ahmed over wide mid-on as Pakistan struggled to get through the defenses.\n\nNew Zealand, on its first test tour to Pakistan since 2002, had made a strong bid to chase down 138 in the last hour of the first test of the two-match series last Friday after Pakistan captain Babar Azam made a daring declaration. Poor visibility halted the Black Caps at 61-1 in the eighth over to draw the game.\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board was forced to organize both test matches in Karachi due to weather concerns in Multan, where winter smog and fog have delayed flights and may have disrupted hours of play.

      "text": "Hiring at companies in Saudi Arabia's non-oil sector increased at its strongest pace in about five years in December, driven by \"robust\u201d business activity.\n\nThe reading on the Riyad Bank Saudi Arabia purchasing managers' index came in at 56.9 last month, slower than the 58.5 recorded in November, but still well above the neutral 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.\n\nDespite the lower headline reading, businesses linked the rise in activity to higher sales and improving market demand, with new order inflows rising sharply and 30 per cent of surveyed companies reporting growth, compared with the previous month.\n\nThe acceleration in sales growth drove businesses in the kingdom to increase hiring in December to boost operating efficiency.\n\nThe rate of job creation was the fastest recorded since January 2018, while the increase in staffing capacity helped companies to reduce outstanding work for the seventh month running.\n\n\u201cJob creation in the non-oil sector has never been this strong in almost five years. This is attributed to the ongoing reforms that support the private sector under the Saudi Vision 2030,\u201d said Naif Al-Ghaith, chief economist at Riyad Bank.\n\n\u201cWe see operating conditions remaining favourable in December, characterised by rapid growth in the non-oil activities and a robust labour market by the end of 2022, with both jobs and wages having far more momentum than previously thought.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia's preliminary estimates for 2023 indicate a real gross domestic product growth rate of 3.1 per cent, after an expected expansion of 8.5 per cent last year, Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan said last month as the government approved the budget for this year.\n\nThe kingdom will continue to spend on major projects and programmes related to its Vision 2030 economic transformation plan that seeks to diversify the Arab world's largest economy and reduce its reliance on hydrocarbons, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last month.\n\nThe Vision 2030 programme aims to boost the kingdom's manufacturing, tourism, technology and entertainment industries and open up capital markets to foreign investors.\n\nStrong growth in the kingdom's non-oil GDP will continue this year and \u201congoing economic reforms, ambitious government strategies/initiatives, acceleration in mega/giga projects and the vital role played by national funds will be the economy\u2019s main drivers, shielding it from the global recessionary pressures\u201d, the Saudi National Bank, the country's largest bank by assets, said in a research note on Sunday.\n\nUnlike record inflation rates that hit four-decade highs in the US and Europe, prompting central banks globally to raise interest rates, the kingdom had relatively low inflation last year.\n\nInflation is projected at 2.1 per cent in 2023, according to government forecasts.\n\n\u201cThe increase in interest rates has been offset by the rapid growth, which is expected to be near 9 per cent for 2022,\u201d Mr Al-Ghaith said.\n\nPrices in the kingdom \u201care expected to ease in the upcoming year, with the anticipated drop in international prices caused by the high interest rate and recovered supply chains\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll in all, December data points to a continuous growth for the fourth quarter with optimism on the upcoming year. This made us comfortably project growth of non-oil GDP to exceed 4 per cent in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-oil companies maintained a broadly positive view for the coming year, with optimism largely based on strengthening demand and forecasts of increased investment linked to the Vision 2030 initiative, according to the PMI survey.\n\nThe PMI readings for the UAE and Egypt are expected to be released on Wednesday.",

      "text": "NEW YORK, Jan 3 \u2015 Despite the ongoing pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, global inflation... nothing stopped the art market from having a record year in terms of auctions. However, some auctions were more memorable than others because of the astronomical sums they reached. Here are four that impressed.\n\nChristie's made a touchdown with the auction of the late Swiss gallery owners Thomas and Doris Ammann's art collection. And it scored another with a US$195 million (RM859 million) sale of Andy Warhol's \u201cShot Sage Blue Marilyn\u201d (1964).\n\nThis saturated colour portrait of Marilyn Monroe sold for this historic amount on May 9, after four minutes of bidding. It thus became the most expensive 20th century work ever sold at auction. However, the all-time record still belongs to \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d (16th century), attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and purchased for US$450 million in 2017 by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman. The American press claims that the buyer of \u201cShot Sage Blue Marilyn\u201d was famous New York gallery owner Larry Gagosian, without specifying whether he acted for himself or for a client.\n\nThis iconic Andy Warhol painting had been estimated by Christie's to fetch US$200 million, but it had no trouble exceeding that estimate because of its history the series it belongs to. \u201cShot Sage Blue Marilyn\u201d is based on a cropped photograph of actress Marilyn Monroe used to promote her 1953 film \u201cNiagara.\u201d But it is not unique: there are five versions of this painting, all in the hands of private American collectors.\n\nThis was one of the jewels of Paul G. Allen's art collection, which was auctioned off by Christie's. The Microsoft co-founder, who died in 2018, owned more than 150 masterpieces spanning 500 years of art history, most of which are master paintings. \u201cLes Poseuses, Ensemble (Petite version)\u201d is one of them.\n\nPainted in 1888, this work is among Georges Seurat's most famous and iconic. It depicts three young female nudes posing in a studio beside \u201cA Sunday Afternoon on La Grande-Jatte,\u201d another painting by Georges Seurat now housed at the Art Institute of Chicago. The work demonstrates the pointillist technique that made the 19th century Neo-Impressionist painter famous.\n\n\u201cLes Poseuses, Ensemble (Petite version)\u201d had sold for nearly US$1 million at Christie's in 1970. Half a century later, the painting fetched US$149.2 million on November 9, again at Christie's. The auction house had originally estimated it at US$100 million.\n\nThis impressive sale set a new record for Georges Seurat (the previous one was US$35.2 million), and propelled \u201cLes Poseuses, Ensemble (Petite version)\u201d into the small circle of works from Paul Allen's collection which fetched over US$100 million.\n\nThe sale of Paul Allen's art collection was remarkable on many levels. It brought in the historic total of US$1.62 billion and broke many sales records, including that of a work by Paul C\u00e9zanne. This feat was achieved in the exceptional sale of \u201cLa Montagne Sainte-Victoire\u201d on November 9 in New York.\n\nThis painting had been estimated at US$120 million, more than three times the amount Paul Allen bought it for in 2001 (US$38.5 million). Before becoming part of the Microsoft co-founder's collection, \u201cLa Montagne Sainte-Victoire\u201d belonged to Auguste Pellerin, George Embiricos and Heinz Berggruen.\n\nAccording to Artnet, two bidders competed for it at Christie's. One of them finally won the lot for US$137.8 million. This is more than double the previous record price for Paul C\u00e9zanne, set in 1999 with the sale of the still life \u201cRideau, Cruchon et Compotier\u201d for US$60.5 million.\n\nThis spectacular sale also took place on November 9, during the event dedicated to Paul Allen's collection at Christie's in New York. Vincent Van Gogh painted \u201cOrchard with Cypresses\u201d in 1888, when he was staying in Arles. It was in this provincial town that he produced some of his finest works, including \u201cField with Irises near Arles,\u201d \u201cStill Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers\u201d and \u201cThe Starry Night.\u201d\n\nThis painting became part of Paul Allen's collection after he bought it from collectors Charles Shipman and Joan Whitney Payson in June 1998. David Nash, the American billionaire's art advisor, told the New York Times that it is \u201ccertainly an irreplaceable painting,\u201d along with George Seurat's \u201cLes Poseuses Ensemble (Petite version)\u201d and C\u00e9zanne's \u201cLa Montagne Sainte-Victoire.\u201d\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that it went for US$117.1 million, setting a new sales record for a Van Gogh. Until then, the title holder was none other than \u201cThe Portrait of Doctor Gachet,\u201d an oil on canvas dating from 1890. That work had been bought by Japanese businessman Ryoei Saito for US$82.5 million at Christie's in 1990.\n\nHere are the other most expensive artworks sold at auction in 2022:\n\n7. \u201cLarge Interior, W11 (After Watteau)\u201d by Lucian Freud (1981\u201383): US$86.3 million at Christie\u2019s",

      "text": "British author Salman Rushdie, whose writings have made him the target of Iranian death threats, was on a ventilator and could lose an eye after he was repeatedly stabbed at a literary event in New York state Friday.\n\nFollowing the attack just before 11:00 local time Rushdie had been airlifted to the hospital where he needed emergency surgery, and his agent said in a statement obtained by The New York Times that \"the news is not good.\"\n\n\"Salman will likely lose one eye; the nerves in his arm were severed; and his liver was stabbed and damaged,\" said agent Andrew Wylie, who added that as of now Rushdie cannot speak.\n\nNew York state police identified the suspect involved in Friday morning's attack as Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old from Fairfield, New Jersey. A probable motive remained unclear.\n\nPolice said Rushdie was stabbed in the neck as well as the abdomen. A number of people rushed to the stage and took the suspect to the ground, before a trooper present at the event arrested him.\n\nA doctor in the audience administered medical care until emergency first responders arrived. An interviewer onstage, 73-year-old Ralph Henry Reese, suffered a facial injury but has been released from the hospital, police said.\n\nThe attack occurred at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo city.\n\nCarl LeVan, an American University politics professor attending the event, told AFP he saw the suspect run onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and \"stabbed him repeatedly and viciously.\"\n\nLeVan, a Chautauqua regular, said the suspect \"was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued,\" adding that he believed the man \"was trying to kill\" Rushdie.\n\n\"There were gasps of horror and panic from the crowd,\" the professor said.\n\nLeVan said witnessing the event had left him \"shaken,\" adding he considered Chautauqua a safe place of creative freedom.\n\n\"To know that this happened here, and to see it - it was horrific,\" he said. \"What I saw today was the essence of intolerance.\"\n\nAnother witness, John Stein, told ABC that the assailant \"started stabbing on the right side of the head, of the neck. And there was blood... erupting\".",

      "text": "Josie Pagani is a commentator on current affairs and a regular contributor to Stuff. She works in geopolitics, aid and development, and governance.\n\nOPINION: I hate name-droppers. Anyway, in the 1990s, writer Salman Rushdie came to New Zealand and had dinner with my mum and other New Zealand writers, including my then stepfather Maurice Shadbolt. They were told to arrive at a restaurant to meet an unnamed guest, and tell no-one.\n\nLife for the author of The Satanic Verses was one spent in hiding following the fatwa of the Ayatollah of Iran calling on Muslims to kill him, along with all those \u2018\u2019involved in the publication\u2019\u2019 of the novel.\n\nHe is at least alive. His Japanese publisher, Professor Hitoshi Igarashi, was slaughtered in 1991. His Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot and left for dead, but survived. He called Rushdie from his hospital bed: \u201cI just want you to know that I am very proud to be the publisher of The Satanic Verses.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* In 1992, author Salman Rushdie wasn't sure he'd ever be safe\n\n* Would Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses be published today?\n\n* Salman Rushdie's agent says author 'on the road to recovery'\n\n* Author Salman Rushdie off ventilator and talking following stabbing attack\n\nNot everyone was as courageous.\n\nSome of the Establishment paraded their schadenfreude because Rushdie, Indian-born, had denounced British imperialism. Journalist Charles Moore captured the mood: Rushdie, \u201cused to attacking whitey with impunity\u201d, was \u201csuddenly seeking whitey\u2019s help\u201d.\n\nChildren\u2019s author Roald Dahl wrote to The Times of London saying Rushdie \u2018\u2019must have been totally aware of the deep and violent feelings his book would stir up among devout Muslims\u2019\u2019. He wrote that we all \"have a moral obligation to apply a modicum of censorship to our own work in order to reinforce this principle of free speech\".\n\nLife for Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses, was life in hiding following the fatwa of the Ayatollah of Iran calling on Muslims to kill him.\n\nThriller writer John le Carr\u00e9 had a more subtle but no less objectionable position: That those who write literature are impertinent to believe they have some special claim to free speech. \u201cAre we to believe that those who write literature have a greater right to free speech than those who write pulp?\u201d\n\nNotice how \u2018\u2018I oppose the violence, but \u2026\u201d slides into excuses for the violence.\n\nThe common principle of Rushdie\u2019s critics is that if you offend someone\u2019s beliefs then you are at least partly in the wrong, and so threats are somewhat excused. Giving offence justifies violence.\n\nIt is monstrous position. Words are not violence. Violence is violence.\n\nIf you give offence you are not protected from criticism. Stupid and offensive comments are words. They should be debated, ridiculed, disproven \u2013 with words. You should not be murdered, locked up, sanctioned, or threatened.\n\nHold the violent to account for their violence. Do not make excuses. Do not give comfort to their motive. Give comfort to the enemies of violence.\n\nBeing prepared to offend is how we progress. You cannot tell people that the Earth orbits the sun when centuries of status and identity depends on forcing everyone to agree that the sun goes around the Earth. Usually, offensive views are simply offensive. But sometimes, occasionally, they are Galileo.\n\nJosie Pagani: \u201cWhen wealthy and successful diners didn\u2019t pay their bills, the cost came out of our salaries, so I feel you have a right to be a grumpy diner, like me, only if you support paying restaurant workers a living wage.\u201d\n\nHow are you going to tell truth-tellers from the bad mannered? Who is going to make the call about which is which? Ayatollahs? A panel of expert judges appointed by the government and clergy of the day?\n\nYou may be thinking: It\u2019s easy to identity hateful Nazis and racists, so just ban that. In 1938, Hitler's Mein Kampf had been banned in many countries. In the US, a group of German exiled students painstakingly translated it into English, footnotes and all, in a desperate attempt to get people to understand Hitler\u2019s plans for genocide. If only people had read it and understood in 1938.\n\nIf only our secret services had understood the threat of white supremacists before March 15, 2019.\n\nPutting up with vile, nasty, dehumanising words is the price of our freedom and safety, of being adults able to detect truth and falsehood for ourselves, and of not being subjected to lies and suppression.\n\nFear of giving offence is causing writer JK Rowling to be cancelled. \u2018\u2019It causes columnists like me to pause before defending her right to have her say,\u2019\u2019 says Pagani.\n\nAuthor JK Rowling tweeted her support for Rushdie this week. She was told, \u2018\u2019You're next\u2019\u2019. You don\u2019t have to agree with Rowling\u2019s views to condemn the threat without using the word \u2018\u2019but\u2019\u2019.\n\nFear of giving offence is causing her to be cancelled. It causes columnists like me to pause before defending her right to have her say.\n\nFear of violence and fear of offence might prevent The Satanic Verses being published today. Cancelled, it would avoid offending anyone. We would be deprived of the right to decide the book\u2019s merits for ourselves.\n\nBut fear is the point of terrorism. So decide not to be afraid.\n\nMy mother apparently suggested to Rushdie that he could safely take refuge on Stewart Island. He politely chose to risk death instead.\n\nAfter the fatwa, writers Susan Sontag, Norman Mailer and 700 others signed a statement of solidarity: \u201cWe too have been \u2018involved in the publication\u2019 of The Satanic Verses.\u201d\n\nI admire even more the courageous booksellers and their minimum wage staff in street-level shops, with no security, who decided to keep selling the book.\n\nNot to do so is to empower extremists and terrorists to continue. We all, still, must stand with Salman Rushdie.",

The full interview, which is part of a documentary, will be shown Tuesday on ZDF.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Picking Qatar as World Cup host a 'mistake', admits ex-Fifa president Sepp Blatter\n\n* Qatar authorities may allow rainbow flags and political protests during World Cup\n\n* UK minister tells gay World Cup fans to 'be respectful' in Qatar\n\n\u201cOf course such comments are terrible, and that is the reason why we are working on things in Qatar hopefully improving,\u201d Nancy Faeser said.\n\nAbout 1.2 million international visitors are expected in Qatar for the tournament, which has faced criticism and scepticism ever since the gas-rich emirate was selected as host by Fifa in December 2010.\n\nThe Fifa World Cup in Qatar kicks off in less than two weeks' time, the first to be held in the Middle East.\n\nConcerns about LGBTQ tourists attending the World Cup have also been expressed for a long time.\n\nIn the interview, Salman also said that homosexuality \u201cis a spiritual harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the World Cup, many things will come here to the country. Let\u2019s talk about gays,\u201d Salman said in English, which is simultaneously dubbed into German in the TV segment.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is, everybody will accept that they come here. But they will have to accept our rules.\u201d\n\nThe interview was cut short by a media officer of the World Cup organising committee after Salman expressed his views on homosexuals, ZDF reported.\n\nFaeser, who is also responsible for sports, said when she visited Qatar a week ago that the country\u2019s prime minister had given her a \u201csafety guarantee\u201d for fans \u201cno matter where they come from, whom they love and what they believe in.\u201d\n\nFaeser said there has been no change to that stance from the prime minister, who is also Qatar\u2019s interior minister. She plans to go ahead with a trip to Germany\u2019s opening World Cup match against Japan.\n\nEngland captain Harry Kane says \"it's really sad\" some LGBTQ fans won't travel to the Qatar World Cup.\n\nLast month, Germany's ambassador to Qatar was summoned by the government there after Faeser appeared to criticise the country for its human rights record.\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesperson Ned Price called the remarks by the Qatari official a \u201cgreat concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a relationship with Qatar that allows us to discuss our areas of mutual interest, but it also allows us to discuss what is important with the United States and values of tolerance, diversity, of respecting all people regardless of who they are or whom they love,\u201d Price said.",

      "text": "Author Salman Rushdie is in hospital with serious injuries after being stabbed by a man at an arts festival in New York state on Saturday NZT. The following article was published on the 30th anniversary of the release of The Satanic Verses.\n\nOPINION: One of the most controversial books in recent literary history, Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses, was published three decades ago this month and almost immediately set off angry demonstrations all over the world, some of them violent.\n\nA year later, in 1989, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa, or religious ruling, ordering Muslims to kill the author.\n\nBorn in India to a Muslim family, but by then a British citizen living in the UK, Rushdie was forced to go into protective hiding for the greater part of a decade.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Salman Rushdie creates modern Don Quixote\n\n* The high-maintenance husbands: Padma Lakshmi and Salman Rushdie are a 'type'\n\n* Author Salman Rushdie stabbed in attack on stage in New York\n\nWhat was \u2013 and still is \u2013 behind this outrage?\n\nThe book, \u201cSatanic Verses,\u201d goes to the heart of Muslim religious beliefs when Rushdie, in dream sequences, challenges and sometimes seems to mock some of its most sensitive tenets.\n\nMuslims believe that the Prophet Muhammed was visited by the angel Gibreel \u2013 Gabriel in English \u2013 who, over a 22-year period, recited God\u2019s words to him. In turn, Muhammed repeated the words to his followers. These words were eventually written down and became the verses and chapters of the Quran.\n\nRushdie\u2019s novel takes up these core beliefs. One of the main characters, Gibreel Farishta, has a series of dreams in which he becomes his namesake, the angel Gibreel.\n\nIn these dreams, Gibreel encounters another central character in ways that echo Islam\u2019s traditional account of the angel\u2019s encounters with Muhammed.\n\nRushdie chooses a provocative name for Muhammed. The novel\u2019s version of the Prophet is called Mahound \u2013 an alternative name for Muhammed sometimes used during the Middle Ages by Christians who considered him a devil.\n\nIn addition, Rushdie\u2019s Mahound puts his own words into the angel Gibreel\u2019s mouth and delivers edicts to his followers that conveniently bolster his self-serving purposes.\n\nDemonstrators protesting against the book, The Satanic Verses.\n\nEven though, in the book, Mahound\u2019s fictional scribe, Salman the Persian, rejects the authenticity of his master\u2019s recitations, he records them as if they were God\u2019s.\n\nIn Rushdie\u2019s book, Salman, for example, attributes certain actual passages in the Quran that place men \u201cin charge of women\u201d and give men the right to strike wives from whom they \u201cfear arrogance,\u201d to Mahound\u2019s sexist views.\n\nThrough Mahound, Rushdie appears to cast doubt on the divine nature of the Quran.\n\nFor many Muslims, Rushdie, in his fictional retelling of the birth of Islam\u2019s key events, implies that, rather than God, the Prophet Muhammed is himself the source of revealed truths.\n\nIn Rushdie\u2019s defence, some scholars have argued that his \u201cirreverent mockery\u201d is intended to explore whether it is possible to separate fact from fiction.\n\nLiterature expert Greg Rubinson points out that Gibreel is unable to decide what is real and what is a dream.\n\nSince the publication of The Satanic Verses, Rushdie has argued that religious texts should be open to challenge. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we debate Islam?\u201d Rushdie said in a 2015 interview.\n\n\u201cIt is possible to respect individuals, to protect them from intolerance, while being sceptical about their ideas, even criticising them ferociously.\u201d\n\nThis view, however, clashes with the view of those for whom the Quran is the literal word of God.\n\nAfter Khomeini\u2019s death, Iran\u2019s government announced in 1998 that it would not carry out his fatwa or encourage others to do so. Rushdie now lives in the United States and makes regular public appearances.\n\nStill, 30 years later, threats against his life persist. Although mass protests have stopped, the themes and questions raised in his novel remain hotly debated.\n\nMyriam Renaud is affiliated with the Faculty of Contemporary World Religions at the Union Institute & University, US.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

      "text": "* Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman was acquitted of NAB reference on merit by accountability court.\n\nAn Additional District and Sessions Court (South) has issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Salman Iqbal, chief executive officer of ARY Network, and anchorperson Arshad Sharif after they failed to appear in a case pertaining to running a smear campaign through a talk show, Power Play, against Jang/Geo Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.\n\nThe local court had earlier issued their bailable arrest warrants but they neither appeared before it nor submitted the bail amount.\n\nJang Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman was acquitted of a NAB reference on January 31, 2022, on merit by an accountability court.\n\nThe reference was about a land purchase from a private owner in 1986.\n\nIn the ARY News talk show, Power Play, aired on February 1, while running a defamation campaign, the anchorperson \"deliberately misinterpreted\" the January 31 judgment of a Lahore accountability court alleging that the court acquitted Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman in the case, due to the amendments in the NAB Ordinance in the year 2021, thereby receiving an NRO, rather than the case being decided on merit.\n\nIn fact, Jang Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman was acquitted of the NAB reference on January 31, 2022 on merit by Honourable Accountability Court No 1, Lahore.\n\nWhile passing the judgment, the court apparently did not rely on the NAB Amendments added/amended in the year 2021 and gave its conclusive finding in para No24, of the said judgment.\n\nThe relevant para reproduced in the order read, \u201cThere is no supportive material with the prosecution to prove the involvement of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman and his co-accused in this case and there is no probability of the petitioner/ accused and his co-accused being convicted, hence further proceedings in the case would be nothing but a futile exercise which must be curbed under section 265-K Cr. P.C. The court is competent to exercise its power under section 265-K Cr.P.C. where, taking available material as true, yet there is no probability of conviction or where charge appears to be groundless and the further process would be nothing but an abuse of process of law.\u201d\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that on previous occasions, ARY London had repeatedly apologised for defaming Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief Jang/Geo submitted a private complaint against ARY CEO Salman Iqbal and anchor Arshad Sharif in the court of Additional District and Sessions Court Judge-XI (South).\n\nDuring the hearing of the complaint, the judge observed that the complainants have brought sufficient material against the accused and had made out, prima facie, a case for their under sections 500, 501 and 502 read with Section 499 of the PPC. The court summoned the accused through bailable warrants in the sum of Rs100,000 each to face the trial but they neither turned up nor deposited the bail amount.\n\nNow the Additional District and Sessions Court Judge-XI (South) has issued arrest warrants against the accused and directed the Artillery Maidan SHO to arrest and produce them in court.\n\nThe hearing has been adjourned until October 10.",

      "text": "The Paris-based Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia topped donor countries in providing official development assistance (humanitarian and development) in 2021 to low- and middle-income countries, with an amount of US$ 7.12 billion.\n\nThis aid constitutes 1.05 percent of the Kingdom\u2019s gross national income, which means it has exceeded the target set by the United Nations, which is for donor countries to allocate 0.7 percent of their gross national income as official development aid, Khalid Hamoud Al-Kahtani - Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Sri Lanka, in a media statement said.\n\nThe directives of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, contributed to this great achievement that placed the Kingdom at the forefront of international humanitarian action with all merits and entitlements.\n\nThe Kingdom was throughout its history, and is still, a benevolent country that extends its hand of goodness to help the distressed and provide relief to the needy wherever they are. The Kingdom continues on the same noble approach that embodies the established values of its wise leadership and its generous people, and that the exceptional and successive achievements come as a result of the Kingdom\u2019s ambitious Vision 2030.\n\nAccording to the data of the OECD for the year 2021, the most prominent sectors of development aid are humanitarian operations, food security, shelter, education, water, environment and health.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia provided multiple assistances to implement development projects in Sri Lanka as well over the last several years. The Saudi Fund for Development has provided nearly US$ 455 million to finance 46 projects.\n\nThe most important ones among them are the Colombo Water Supply and Sewerage in Colombo City (SR 99.9 million); Electric Power Transmission (SR 48.13 million); Mahaweli Ganga Downstream Development System \u2018B\u2019 Left Bank (SR 85 million); Health Facilities Development in Colombo City (SR 45 million); Batticaloa \u2013 Trinco Road Development (SR 40 million); Development of Health Facilities in Colombo City (SR 11 million); Epilepsy Hospital and Health Centre (SR 75 million); Kalu Ganga Development (SR 172.5 million); SR 225 million for Road Network Development; SR 225 million for Improvement of Peradeniya \u2013 Badulla \u2013 Chenkaladi Road; SR 45 million for Epilepsy Hospital and Health Centre; SR168.75 million for Development of Left Bank of Kalu Ganga; SR 105 million for Development of Wayamba Township; SR 60 million for Development of Kalu Ganga and SR187.50 million for Construction of the Medical Faculty at Sabragamuwa University.\n\nThe total amount granted for these projects is Saudi Riyal 1,592.78 million, equivalent to US$ 425 million. In addition, the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre has implemented 11 projects, including shelter, food and non-food items, support and coordination of humanitarian operations and charity works from 2005 to September 30, 2022.",

      "text": "Author Sir Salman Rushdie, who has faced death threats for his novel The Satanic Verses, has been stabbed at least once in the neck and once in the abdomen while on stage at an event in New York state.\n\nThe Indian-born British author has been airlifted to hospital but his condition is not yet known. He is still undergoing surgery.\n\nLATEST: Rushdie may lose an eye, agent says\n\nThe 75-year-old was about to give a lecture when a man stormed the stage at the Chautauqua Institution and began attacking Sir Salman as he was being introduced to the audience, according to witnesses.\n\nThe novelist fell to the floor after being attacked by the suspect, who was then pinned down by audience members and staff members who ran on stage. The suspect was arrested by a state trooper soon after and he is now in custody.\n\nHe has been identified as 24-year-old Hadi Matar from Fairview, New Jersey, who bought a pass for the event. Police say they do not yet know a motive for the assault but they believe he was acting alone.\n\nWitness Pilar Pintagro told Sky News: \"We were very scared because the first place (he was stabbed) was in the neck and that's where the blood started to splash everywhere, and then he stabbed him in the shoulders and continued stabbing several times because it was so fast.\n\n\"People from the audience actually jumped on to the stage to try to put him down and Salman was trying to walk away from this guy but he continued stabbing several times, and he was finally pinned down.\"\n\nThe writer was helped by a doctor who was in the audience before emergency services arrived.\n\nPolice said the event's moderator, Henry Reese, suffered a minor head injury after also being attacked.\n\nRead more: Why is Salman Rushdie so controversial?\n\nAnother witness Julia Mineeva Braun told Sky News that as Sir Salman was being introduced \"all of a sudden from the left-hand side of the stage a short man, (dressed) all in black, ran out and he approached Mr Rushdie\".\n\n\"It was very quick... we thought he was fixing his microphone and then we saw the knife. He starting stabbing him in the neck first\u2026 and Mr Rushdie got up and started running. We're still in shock.\"\n\nPilar Pintagro said she had been expecting more security at the event.\n\n\"There were not too many police around,\" she said. \"That's why the people from the audience jumped on to the stage because we were expecting more police. Finally police arrived and pinned him down. But the police took five minutes to arrive.\"\n\nA picture circulating on social media appeared to show Sir Salman with his legs slightly raised and someone applying pressure to his abdomen.\n\nDozens of audience members were present during the incident.\n\nIn a video on Twitter, taken a number of rows back from the stage, a woman could be heard saying: \"Hopefully they can save him because the first knife was right near his artery.\"\n\nJeremy Genovese, 68, from Beachwood, Ohio, said: \"People were in shock, many people in tears.\"\n\nSir Salman, who lives in New York City and became an American citizen in 2016, was due to speak to Henry Reese, from the City of Asylum organisation, a residency programme for writers living in exile under threat of persecution.\n\nThey were expected to discuss America's role as an asylum for writers and other artists in exile and as a home for freedom of creative expression.\n\nState police said: \"At about 11am, a male suspect ran up onto the stage and attacked Rushdie and an interviewer. Rushdie was transported by helicopter to an area hospital.\"\n\nThey added: \"The interviewer suffered a minor head injury. A state trooper assigned to the event immediately took the suspect into custody.\"\n\nRushdie's fourth book, The Satanic Verses, was banned in 1988 in a number countries with large Muslim populations, including Iran, after it was considered by some to contain blasphemous passages.\n\nIn 1989, Iran's then leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Sir Salman's death.\n\nThe Middle East country also offered a bounty of more than $3m for anyone who kills the writer.\n\nIn 1998, Iran's pro-reform government of President Mohammad Khatami distanced itself from the fatwa, saying the threat against Rushdie was over after he had lived in hiding for nine years.\n\nThe book's Japanese translator was stabbed to death in 1991 and other people involved in publishing it were attacked.\n\nBut Ayatollah Khomeini's successor as Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in 2005 that the fatwa was still valid and three hardline clerics called on followers to kill Rushdie.",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",

Now, viewers can behold an illustrious visual that will further raise anticipation across the country. With the official poster release, the Pakistani audience is finally getting a glimpse into the visuals of the coveted film. The film will be distributed nationally by IMGC Distribution Club and will release in cinemas nationwide including in major cities such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad. Written & Directed by Saim Sadiq and Produced by Apoorva Guru Charan, Sarmad Sultan Khoosat, and Lauren Mann, the film\u2019s ensemble cast includes debutants Ali Junejo, Alina Khan, and Rasti Farooq alongside some of Pakistan\u2019s beloved and respected actors like Sarwat Gilani, Sania Saeed, Sohail Sameer, and Salmaan Peerzada.\n\nThe official poster for the film is created from a painting by the superbly talented artist Salman Toor who shared some details about the portrait:\n\n\u201c\u2018Over His Shoulder\u2019 is a portrait of a man looking out from inside an embrace. His slightly defiant gaze shows him as someone who is loved and who gives love back, generously and without fear. The curved stylization of the painting communicates the warmth and humanity of this caress. In Joyland, Saim confidently explores the empowerment and trauma of traditional and non-traditional relationships in a society weaponized by patriarchal ideas of decency and shame. I\u2019m thrilled to lend this image for Sadiq\u2019s incredible and vital new film.\u201d\n\nIn May 2022, \u2018JOYLAND\u2019 made the entire nation proud when it received an 8-minute long standing ovation at its world premiere at the 75th Cannes Film Festival where the motion picture won the \u2018Un Certain Regard Jury Prize\u2019. Following that, it received yet another standing ovation this September 2022 at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) after its North American premiere. The film then won the award for \u2018Best Film of the Subcontinent\u2019 at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne in August.\n\nSet in Lahore, the storyline primarily revolves around \u2018Haider\u2019, the youngest son of a middle-class family who secretly joins the theatre as a background dancer and develops a friendship with \u2018Biba\u2019, a trans dancer struggling to make a mark in theatres. The family drama emphasizes the themes of desire, secrets, and empathy.\n\nThe highly anticipated film has also officially been passed by all the censor boards of Pakistan. The Federal, Punjab, and Sindh censor boards graciously cleared \u201cJoyland\u201d so that the country would welcome the local release of a film that has brought so much honour and acclaim to Pakistan on a global scale.\n\nSheikh Abid Rasheed, the Executive Director of Distribution Club, expressed his excitement at bringing this prestigious film to the Pakistani screens and added that the preparations for the release of the film had entered the final stages. Now that the film\u2019s poster is released, the teaser and trailer are said to be released soon as well. The film begins its promotions in October 2022 before its official release on 18th November when it will finally be in theatres for the Pakistani audience to experience.\n\n\u201cJOYLAND\u201d is an all caps & KHOOSAT FILMS production in association with Diversity Hire Ltd, One Two Twenty Entertainment, Blood Moon Creative, Film Manufacturers Inc, Astrakan AB, and Noruz Films. Producers of the film include Kathryn M. Moseley, Oliver Ridge, April Shih and Katharina Otto-Bernstein.

      "text": "A Saudi Arabian defender\u2019s horrifying injuries have been revealed after a brutal clash in the final minutes of his side\u2019s upset victory over Argentina at the World Cup.\n\nYasser Al Shahrani was unresponsive after he was kneed in the head by his own goalkeeper in stoppage time, with referee Slavko Vincic\u2019s bizarre call to allow play to continue nearby quickly overshadowed by the rapturous result.\n\nWATCH IN THE VIDEO ABOVE: Saudi Arabia defender knocked out in horror clash with teammate.\n\nWatch the latest sport on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >>\n\nIt is the second time in two days FIFA officials have come under fire over their handling of a concussion incident.\n\nAl Shahrani was struck by teammate Mohammed Al-Owais\u2019 knee while chasing a lofted ball inside the box by Argentina in the fifth minute of added time.\n\nThe defender, whose head also bounced off the turf upon landing, did not move while Lionel Messi dribbled just metres away.\n\nWith an increased emphasis on refusing to reward time-wasting at this year\u2019s World Cup, Vincic waited nearly 20 seconds before running to Al Shahrani and call for medical attention.\n\nAn emotional Al-Owais held his hands to his head and gestured for doctors to rush to his teammate\u2019s aid.\n\nThe defender was stretchered from the field and has reportedly been diagnosed with a fractured jaw, broken facial bones and internal bleeding.\n\nThe 30-year-old offered two thumbs up as he was carried out of the stadium.\n\nSaudi Arabia had earlier lost captain Salman Al Faraj to a hamstring injury, with the midfielder substituted at half-time.\n\nThe Saudi government has declared a national holiday for Wednesday to celebrate the monumental upset win over Argentina.\n\nMeanwhile, Messi lamented the second-half capitulation but asked his country to trust in the players to fight back.\n\nArgentina have been considered one of the leading contenders to win the title in what is likely to be the 35-year-old superstar\u2019s final appearance at a World Cup.\n\nThe team entered the Saudi Arabia clash on a 36-match unbeaten run.\n\n\u201cObviously, we have to win now. It\u2019s up to us to fix what we did wrong and get back to the basics of who we are,\u201d Messi said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re OK, obviously hurt by the result, very bitter. But people must trust that this team will not let them down and we are going to go for it in the next two games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played games of this nature before and we\u2019re going to perform well. Now\u2019s the time to be more united than ever, to show how truly strong we are.\u201d\n\nMessi said he was not surprised by the threat from opponents 48 places lower in the world rankings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that this group of players has never been through, it\u2019s been a while since we suffered such a tough blow, we didn\u2019t expect to start like this,\u201d Messi told Argentinian media.\n\nStarting his fifth World Cup, Messi had opened the scoring with a 10th minute penalty and Argentina had three goals disallowed for offside in a free-flowing first half.\n\n\u201cIn five minutes of mistakes (in the second half) that we made, we went 2-1 down and then it was really tough and we lost organisation and started punting the ball,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that his team knew Saudi Arabia, despite being the second-lowest ranked team in the tournament, could hurt them.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were a team who would play if we let them ... They did not surprise us, we knew they could do that.\u201d\n\nArgentina now have to focus on beating Mexico and Poland in their next group games in search of the only major title that has eluded Messi in his otherwise glittering career.",

So it was interesting yesterday to have conversations \u2026 with our younger staff about who he was and what his impact was on the literary world.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cHonestly, I feel like people just came here yesterday because they wanted to talk about how they felt about what happened.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, some users urged people to buy Rushdie\u2019s books in a show of solidarity.\n\nThe Satanic Verses tells the surrealistic tale of two Indian actors whose hijacked plane explodes over the English Channel.\n\nThey somehow make it safely to an English beach, one of them now in the form of an archangel, the other as the devil.\n\nExplosively, Rushdie gave prostitutes in the story the names of the prophet Mohammed\u2019s wives.\n\nHe also created the character of a prophet named Mahound who, under Lucifer\u2019s influence, seems to say that one can pray to gods other than Allah \u2013 before realising his error.\n\nRushdie, who holds both British and American citizenship, remained hospitalised Saturday in serious condition following hours of surgery.",

      "text": "Mohammed bin Salman says Iran is hosting the son of Osama bin Laden.(File video)\n\nEXPLAINED: A US drone strike in Afghanistan last weekend killed Ayman al-Zawahri, the man who helped Osama bin Laden plot the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and helped al-Qaeda survive and spread in the years after.\n\nBy finding and striking al-Zawahiri, US President Joe Biden said, the US was ensuring that Afghanistan under the Taliban would never again become a base for attacks on the rest of the world, as it was in 2001.\n\nWe take a look at the al-Qaeda leader, who evaded US capture for 21 years after the suicide airliner attacks that in many ways changed America and its relations with the rest of the world.\n\nAmericans who lived through the 9/11 attacks may not remember al-Zawahri's name, but many know his face, more than two decades on: a man in glasses, slightly smiling, invariably shown in photos by the side of bin Laden as the two arranged the strike on the United States.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Biden: US drone strike killing al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri delivered 'justice'\n\n* US and Taliban sign peace agreement aimed at ending 18 years of conflict\n\n* Osama bin Laden's mother says son was 'brainwashed' at university\n\n* US strike targets Syrian al-Qaida leader\n\nAn Egyptian, al-Zawahri was born June 19, 1951, to a comfortable family in a leafy, drowsy Cairo suburb. Religiously observant from boyhood, he immersed himself in a violent branch of a Sunni Islamic revival that sought to replace the governments of Egypt and other Arab nations with a harsh interpretation of Islamic rule.\n\nAl-Zawahri worked as an eye surgeon as a young adult, but also roamed central Asia and the Middle East, witnessing Afghans' war against Soviet occupiers in that country, and meeting young Saudi Osama bin Laden and other Arab militants rallying to help Afghanistan expel Soviet troops.\n\nHe was one of hundreds of militants captured and tortured in Egyptian prison after Islamic fundamentalists' assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Biographers say the experience further radicalised him. Seven years later, al-Zawahri was present when Osama bin Laden founded al-Qaeda.\n\nAl-Zawahri merged his own Egyptian militant group with al-Qaeda. He brought al-Qaeda organisational skill and experience \u2013 honed underground in Egypt, evading Egyptian intelligence \u2013 that allowed al-Qaeda to organise cells of followers and strike around the world.\n\nAfter the years of quietly assembling the suicide attackers, funds and plans for the September 11 attack, Zawahri and lieutenants ensured that al-Qaeda survived the global manhunt that followed to attack again.\n\nOn the run after 9/11, al-Zawahri rebuilt al-Qaeda leadership in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and was the supreme leader over branches in Iraq, Asia, Yemen and beyond.\n\nWith a credo of targeting near and far enemies, al-Qaeda after 9/11 carried out years of unrelenting attacks: in Bali, Mombasa, Riyadh, Jakarta, Istanbul, Madrid, London and beyond.\n\nAttacks that killed 52 people in London in 2005 were among al-Qaeda's last devastating attacks in the West, as drone strikes, counterterror raids and missiles launched by the US and others killed al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters and shattered parts of the network.\n\nHow was he killed?\n\nAround sunrise on Sunday (local time), al-Zawahri walked out on the balcony of a house in Kabul, Afghanistan. He apparently lingered outside on the balcony, as US intelligence had noted he often did.\n\nOn this day, a US drone fired two Hellfire missiles at the al-Qaeda leader as he stood, according to US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the strike.\n\nHis presence in Afghanistan had been widely suspected for some time, analysts said. US officials learned this year that al-Zawahri's wife and other family members had moved to a safe house in Kabul recently. Al-Zawahri soon followed, the senior administration officials said.\n\nUS officials \u2013 joined by top leaders all the way up to, eventually, Joe Biden \u2013 spent careful months confirming his identity, and his fateful practice of standing alone on that same balcony, and planned the strike.\n\nWhat does his killing mean for al-Qaeda?\n\nIt depends on which al-Qaeda lieutenant succeeds him. And after decades of US and other strikes, that's a pretty thin group.\n\nAl-Qaeda expert Ali Soufan points to an Egyptian, Saif al-Adl, as one of the candidates to be dreaded by the West, given al-Adl's revered status within al-Qaeda, his experience, and the potential of his charisma to draw back al-Qaeda defectors who've moved to other groups.\n\nBut al-Qaeda overall now faces a succession crisis and a shaky future. That includes rivalries against aggressive upstart extremist groups that came into being after 9/11 and also have a presence in Afghanistan.\n\nCharles Lister, another expert in violent extremist networks, wrote after the killing that the nature and spread of conflicts around the Middle East, Africa and South Asia today favour locally focused jihadist organisations rather than globally focused ones.\n\nAl-Qaeda's next leader will have to prove his relevance to \u201cself-confident affiliates that have been more willing to push back against a central leadership perceived as detached from the realities of conflicts thousands of miles away\u201d, Lister wrote.\n\nDid the Taliban know al-Zawahri was in Afghanistan?\n\nUndoubtedly, US officials said. It wasn't clear how long al-Zawahri had been in Afghanistan, but his presence there had been widely rumoured for some time, said Asfandyar Mir, a Central Asia expert with the US Institute of Peace.\n\nNot only that: the house where al-Zawahri was living with his family was owned by a top aide to senior Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, according to a senior US intelligence official.\n\nIt could be that someone among the Taliban sold out al-Zawahri and his family to US or other foreign interests. But it was a Taliban government that took in al-Qaeda's leaders in the mid-1990s and allowed them to plot the 9/11 attacks there, sparking the 20-year US-led war there.\n\nThe worry after al-Zawahri's death in Afghanistan's capital was that the Taliban were allowing armed extremist organisations a home in Afghanistan again in the wake of the US withdrawal, as the West had feared.",

It is a $500bn megacity and the brainchild of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nA news story from 2020 suggests that NEOM is intended to cover an area the size of Belgium. The plan is for the city to act as a hub for modern technology and tourism. It will cover a total area of 26,500 square kilometers and extend 170km along the coast of the Red Sea.\n\nNEOM already has its own airport, NEOM Bay Airport (NUM), operating direct flights to select regional and international destinations using the current national carrier Saudia, with a NEOM branded livery.\n\nAccording to reports, the new airline would position NEOM as a hub for international tourists, with direct flights to cities in Europe and Asia. It is understood that the Kingdom plans to brand NEOM as the sole destination for its dedicated airline.\n\nJust like RIA, the new airline is backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF).",

They then wrote that their comment was an \u201cindication\u201d of others who live in the United Kingdom.\n\nRowling is among the authors and notable faces who have voiced their disbelief after Rushdie\u2019s stabbing.\n\nThe Indian-born British author, 75, whose writing led to death threats from Iran in the 1980s, was to deliver a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution when the incident occurred.\n\nHe is on a ventilator and may lose an eye and has sustained nerve damage to his arm and liver, according to The New York Times.\n\nOn Friday, New York state police named the suspected attacker as Hadi Matar, 24, of New Jersey, who was taken into custody following the incident.\n\nA preliminary review of his social media shows he had sympathies for Shia extremism and Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, a law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the investigation said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what motivated the Twitter user\u2019s apparent threat against Rowling.\n\nThe Harry Potter author has been criticised heavily in recent years for her views about transgender women, with many calling her \u201cTERF\u201d or a trans-exclusionary radical feminist. Some have also criticised some of her famed Harry Potter characters as problematic, including goblin bankers who embody anti-Semitic stereotypes.\n\nSince the suspect was identified, people on social media have asked if the attack was in relation to Iran\u2019s former leader Ayatollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death.\n\nThe call was issued following the publication of Rushdie\u2019s book The Satanic Verses, which has been banned in Iran since 1988 as many Muslims view it as blasphemous.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery, which has the rights to Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter franchise, said it stands with her and all author\u2019s rights to express themselves.\n\n\u201cWBD believes in freedom of expression, peaceful discourse and supporting those who offer their views in the public arena,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts are with Sir Salman Rushdie and his family following the senseless act of violence in New York.\u201d",

These are stories that we often don\u2019t open for comments, because of the high volume of posts that breach our rules for participation. We hope that providing a specific platform for a finite period of time will allow for important debate and different points of view, without the open slather of social media and the risk of discussions being hijacked by extreme views.\n\nFriday\u2019s topic is on whether the Fifa World Cup in Qatar. The comment stream will be open from 12pm to 5pm on Friday November 25, and will be strictly moderated according to our terms and conditions, so please read them before you start posting.\n\nThe Fifa World Cup is usually full of drama and controversy on the field. But this year\u2019s tournament in Qatar has almost been more infamous for the controversy off it.\n\nQatar has been under scrutiny for its human rights record and laws criminalising homosexuality and its treatment of migrant workers.\n\nFifa, football\u2019s governing body, issued a warning just hours before England and the Netherlands were set to play. The captains of seven European teams \u2013 including the Dutch and English captains \u2013 were planning to wear the heart-shaped, multicoloured logo of the \u201cOne Love\u201d campaign. Fifa said the players would immediately be shown a yellow card and could face further consequences.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Germany's players cover mouths at World Cup in Fifa protest\n\n* Belgium's Foreign Minister confronts Fifa president while wearing 'One Love' armband\n\n* 18-year-old Gavi leads Spain to 7-0 rout of Costa Rica at World Cup\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar has also banned the consumption of alcohol at games, despite previously saying this would be allowed, and beer company Budweiser being a sponsor of the tournament.\n\nChampagne, wine, whisky and other alcohol is still to be served in the luxury hospitality areas of the stadiums.\n\nRestrictions have been placed on what fans are allowed to wear. They must be fully dressed at all times and no \u201cintimate parts\u201d can be revealed. So taking off your shirt or wearing a bikini is not an option.\n\nGermany's players covered their mouths to protest the clampdown on \u201cOne Love\u201d armbands at the Fifa World Cup.\n\nWe want Stuff readers to share their thoughts on this Fifa World Cup in the comments.\n\nQatar won its bid to host the tournament in 2010. Executive committee members voted it as the best option over the United States, with 14 votes for Qatar and eight for the US. In 2010, Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup during the same vote as Qatar. Since then 17 of the 22 FIFA executive committee members have been banned or indicted over allegations of corruption and wrongdoing\n\nSepp Blatter, Fifa\u2019s president at the time Qatar was selected to host the world, said this month the decision was a mistake.  Most of the criticism of Qatar has focused on the conservative Muslim country\u2019s human rights record, whether that be its anti-LGBT laws (being homosexual is a crime punishable by three years in prison or even death), women\u2019s rights, or its treatment of migrant workers.  Some teams and players at the tournament and fans around the world, are finding ways to protest the issues that concern them.  The English football team travelled to the Fifa World Cup in Virgin Atlantic's LGBTI+ Pride plane named Rain Bow, as a show of defiance against Qatar\u2019s laws.  Germany's players covered their mouths for the team photo before their opening World Cup match on Thursday to protest against Fifa following the governing body's clampdown on the \u201cOne Love\u201d armband.  Meanwhile, former Qatari national team player and tournament ambassador Khalid Salman has described homosexuality as a \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d. He said being gay was \u201charam,\u201d or forbidden in Arabic, and that he had a problem with children seeing gay people.\n\nAn estimated 6500 migrant workers in Qatar from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in the last decade working on stadiums and infrastructure for the tournament. Qatar disputes this, claiming only 38 deaths have been work-related.  1.2 million international tourists are expected to visit Qatar during the World Cup.  About 3 million people live in Qatar, meaning it is the smallest host by size since the 1954 tournament in Switzerland.  Thousands of empty seats have been seen at the games so far.    Unsold beer from the games will be sent to the country that wins the tournament.",

      "text": "This move means accepting the occupation of Palestine by a Muslim and Arab state and granting concessions to Israel for occupying Palestinian lands and trying to change the population in the interests of the Jewish people.\n\nThe start of Netanyahu's second term in 2009 coincided with Israel's efforts to forge closer ties with conservative Persian Gulf monarchies, including the UAE. The second important development in the process of revealing the UAE's relations with the Zionist regime is the invitation of Abu Dhabi from this regime to participate in the \"Expo 2020\" exhibition, and Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to attend this exhibition.\n\nThe seriousness of the normalization of relations between the UAE and Israel was met with major opposition from Muslims and Arabs and of course, the agreement of some Arab countries. At the same time, the Palestinian Authority condemned the agreement \"in the strongest possible terms\", calling it a \"violation\" of rights and a \"betrayal\" of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe most important aspect of the importance of normalizing the UAE's relations with Israel was the timing of the agreement. Before the UAE, Egypt had compromised with the Zionist regime by signing the Camp David Accords in 1978. But Egypt signed the Camp David Accords at a time when it was in a weak position and the Arab countries had lost four consecutive wars to the occupying regime. However, the UAE signed a peace agreement with the Zionist regime at a time when the regime was on the verge of decline and was under siege by the resistance. At the time of the Abu Dhabi-Tel Aviv agreement, the Zionist regime had finally agreed to form a fragile coalition cabinet despite holding internal elections. The failure of Netanyahu's cabinet to deal with the corona outbreak and the protests by the people of the occupied territories was also to blame. It was unfortunate once again that a normalization agreement was reached on August 13, the \"Day of Islamic Resistance\" or the day of Israel's defeat in the 33-day war with Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006. Therefore, it can be said that the announcement of the UAE's official agreement with the Zionist regime on August 13 was done purposefully and with prior planning.\n\nThe very important and strategic goal of this agreement was to reduce the importance of the Palestinian issue from a major issue in the Islamic world to a normal and insignificant issue. This goal was on the agenda of the US government by US presidents, especially during the Trump era, and was a prelude to the implementation of the Century Deal Plan. Of course, the common ground between Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv on the Saudi coalition's invasion of Yemen should also be seen as an incentive for them to move closer together.\n\nRegarding the normalization of relations between the Arab reactionary countries and the Zionist regime, several points should be considered.\n\n1- As a result of this treacherous act of Abu Dhabi, no matter how much Israel opens its feet in the Persian Gulf, the security of the region will definitely be overshadowed. The issue that the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf should pay attention to is that the Zionists will never act in the national interests of the Muslim and Arab countries and the nature of Zionism is based on confrontation with the Islamic world. Basically, the security of the Zionist regime is in the conflict of the countries of the region and in this sense, there is a concern that the normalization of relations will lead to differences and tensions between the countries of the region.\n\n2. The opening of Israel in the Persian Gulf countries and in the vicinity of Iran should not be compared with the presence of the Axis of Resistance next to the occupied territories, because the Zionist regime by the Palestinian Resistance Forces, Hezbollah and other Axis forces in Syria from around and completely in There is a security siege. If the presence of this regime in the countries bordering the Persian Gulf can not be considered as an attempt to blockade Iran's security or change the security balance. The axis of resistance is a legitimate current that has put some countermeasures on the agenda to defend the security of the region against the attacks of the Zionist regime. Given this fact, some other countries, especially Saudi Arabia, despite the US pressure to establish relations with Israel, are concerned about some of the political, diplomatic and security consequences of this action. Perhaps this is why King Salman of Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stated that without an independent Palestinian state, there is no possibility of normalizing relations with Israel.\n\n3- One of the important goals of the Zionist regime to strengthen relations with the UAE is to try to form a coalition between the Cooperation Council and Israel against Iran. This goal has been dictated to the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates by the leaders of the Zionist regime and the United States for years, and the United States intends to form a Hebrew-Arab coalition to take control of Iran in West Asia. Inducing the so-called threat of Iran's regional power for the security of the Persian Gulf countries is also a pretext for the United States to sell arms to reactionary Arab countries and plunder their oil money. Of course, the UAE is not a major player in regional and international developments, and given the involvement of Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Yemen, the idea of \u200b\u200bcreating an anti-Iranian coalition of countries that have a set of border political, ideological and economic differences in their relations. It is far from happening.\n\n4. The UAE's attempt to attract huge Jewish investments is naturally part of the tendency of the UAE economist rulers, and it can be imagined that the Zionists, by making such promises, have pushed Abu Dhabi into a political quagmire. Saudi Arabia also tried to attract Jewish businessmen and owners of large American and non-American companies and banks through the Davos Desert Summit but to no avail. The UAE, which had the highest financial costs and casualties in the Yemeni war after Saudi Arabia, with the lowest interest and victory, can not hope to attract the Jews of Zionism.\n\n5- The most important and serious obstacle to the normalization of relations between the Arab reactionary countries and Israel is the opposition of the public opinion of the Islamic world. The strength of this opposition is such that to this day the Emirati authorities have been cautious about this issue because they have to answer to their own people and the Islamic world, because the anger of the people may cause serious damage to the UAE and even chaos in this country. In the future, this maximum pressure and opposition will prevent the announcement of the normalization of relations leading to the desired results of the Arab rulers and the Zionists, and at the same time will lead to further cohesion and strengthening of the axis of resistance.\n\n6. Iran's position in this regard is quite clear and considers the Zionist regime as the axis of evil and the main cause of insecurity in the region. Certainly, in the event of such an event, the country's officials will take the necessary measures.",

      "text": "From format to the title favourites, here's what you need to know about the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nMore than a million football fans are expected to descend on Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which begins on Sunday, November 20.\n\nIt will mark the first time the tournament has been held in the Middle East, and the Gulf state has been a controversial choice. As well as allegations of corruption in the selection process, Qatar\u2019s human rights record \u2013 including its treatment of migrant workers and harsh stance on LGBT+ people \u2013 has been put in the spotlight.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know if you\u2019re travelling there for the World Cup.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Why Qatar is a controversial host of the 2022 Fifa World Cup\n\n* Qatar to count emissions from World Cup shuttle flights\n\n* Lufthansa trolls Qatar World Cup with 'Diversity Wins' livery\n\nQatar will be the first Middle Eastern country to host the FIFA World Cup.\n\nBefore you go\n\nAll foreigners travelling to Qatar during the World Cup (up until December 22) will need a \u201cHayya\u201d card, in place of a usual tourist visa. Also known as a Fan ID, this document serves as an entry permit to Qatar, and gives match ticket-holders access to stadiums, as well as free access to public transport.\n\nTravellers staying in Qatar for more than 24 hours are also required to have pre-booked accommodation, which is approved as part of the Hayya card application process. Even those planning to stay with friends or family must register this accommodation on the Hayya portal website.\n\nAhead of the World Cup, Qatar has dropped most of its Covid requirements. But those who test positive while in Qatar are required to self-isolate for five days, followed by a further five days wearing a mask around other people.\n\nDrinking alcohol will be limited to licensed hotel bars and restaurants and special fan zones open at specific periods.\n\nWhat to pack (and what not to pack)\n\nQatar is a Muslim nation, and local laws and customs reflect this.\n\nWhile you can wear what you like within the confines of your hotel \u2013 including swimwear \u2013 when in public areas like shopping malls or the Doha Corniche, it\u2019s best to show respect by dressing modestly. That means clothes that cover shoulders and knees \u2013 and that goes for both men and women.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t pack any alcohol \u2013 it\u2019s illegal to bring it into Qatar, and you can\u2019t even purchase it from duty-free (more on where you can drink soon). Pork products, pornography (including sex toys) and religious books and materials are also banned.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to leave your vape at home \u2013 e-cigarettes are illegal in Qatar, and anyone caught with one could be fined up to 10,000 Qatari riyals (NZ$4500) or face up to three months in prison.\n\nWhere you can drink\n\nThe legal drinking age in Qatar is 21. Access to alcohol is generally limited to licensed restaurants and bars in hotels.\n\nHowever, for the World Cup, there will be special \u201cfan zones\u201d where beer can be consumed, but only between 6.30pm and 1am. Half a litre of beer in these areas will reportedly cost 50 Qatari riyals (NZ$22).\n\nAlcohol will also be available on stadium grounds for a period before and after a game. However, it will not be available during a game, and you can\u2019t drink within sight of the pitch.\n\nThere is zero tolerance for drinking in public and being drunk in public is a crime that could result in a prison sentence of up to six months. However, a Reuters report suggested leniency may be shown towards World Cup fans.\n\nPDA is generally frowned upon in Qatar (though some World Cup celebrations are to be expected).\n\nPublic displays of affection \u2013 kissing and hugging \u2013 are generally frowned upon in Qatar, though holding hands is ok.\n\nSwearing is considered an obscene act, and certain hand gestures are very offensive. You should avoid \u201cflipping the bird\u201d, the \u201cV\u201d sign, and even a thumbs-up. Pointing at someone is also considered rude.\n\nTake care with what you photograph. Government buildings and military sites are usually off limits \u2013 pay attention to signs saying \u201cno photography\u201d \u2013 and you shouldn\u2019t take pictures of local people without their consent.\n\nQatar also has strict laws about littering, with hefty fines for dropping rubbish on roads or in public places. The public hygiene laws also prohibit spitting and urinating in public places.\n\nSupporters from Tunisia pose for a picture at Souq Waqif in Doha.\n\nHomosexuality is illegal in Qatar. Sex outside marriage is also prohibited.\n\nQatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani told the UN General Assembly in September that fans will be welcomed \u201cwithout discrimination\u201d, though did not refer to any specific groups.\n\nHowever, former Qatari national team player Khalid Salman \u2013 an ambassador for the World Cup \u2013 has reignited concerns about treatment of LGBT+ visitors in recent weeks after he described homosexuality as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d during a TV interview.\n\nEarlier this year, a team of Norwegian, Swedish and Danish reporters contacted 69 hotels on FIFA\u2019s official accommodation list, posing as a newlywed gay couple. They found three refused to accept their reservations, while 20 others agreed to accommodate them as long as they did not publicly display their sexuality. Thirty-three hotels had no issues.\n\nIn response, FIFA said it would ensure hotels were made aware of \u201cstrict requirements in relation to welcoming guests in a non-discriminatory manner\u201d. Those who failed to comply would have their contracts terminated.\n\nAuthorities will also turn a blind eye to unmarried couples or friends of different genders sharing hotel rooms.\n\nNew Zealanders travelling to Qatar are encouraged to register their details with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).\n\nThe closest New Zealand embassy is in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nMFAT warns: \u201cDue to the lack of Embassy presence in Qatar, the ability to provide consular assistance is limited, particularly during the World Cup.\u201d",

      "text": "LIV Golf Invitational Series: All you need to know ahead of inaugural tournament at Centurion Club\n\nLIV Golf Invitational Series: All you need to know ahead of inaugural tournament at Centurion Club\n\nAfter months of speculation and back-and-forth between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour, the new Saudi-backed series is to get under way on the outskirts of London on Thursday. Here's all you need to know about who is taking part, what is the format, and why the new league has been so controversial...\n\nThe event is not being recognised by the Official Golf World Ranking (OWGR), meaning no world ranking points will be on offer during the tournament, although that has not stopped a number of high-profile names agreeing to play at the Centurion Club.\n\nFormer world No 1 Dustin Johnson and Ryder Cup legends Sergio Garcia, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood were among the most notable names to commit, with major champions Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell and Louis Oosthuizen also involved. Phil Mickelson was added to that list on Monday evening after months of controversy surrounding comments he made about the breakaway series.\n\nFormer British Masters champion Richard Bland and PGA Tour veteran Kevin Na also signed up, while reigning US Amateur winner James Piot is among the young players featuring in England.\n\nSome 42 players were initially named in the field for the inaugural event, with five more added after the Asian Tour event at Slaley Hall on Sunday.\n\nLooking ahead to the second event at Pumpkin Ridge in Portland from June 30 to July 2, Bryson DeChambeau has said he will play in it and Patrick Reed and Rickie Fowler are reportedly set to join him.\n\nJohnson, Na, Garcia, Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel and Branden Grace have all resigned from the PGA Tour, but Mickelson and DeChambeau do not plan to do so.\n\nJohnson's decision to resign from the PGA Tour means that as of now he is unable to be selected for future Ryder Cups, although he remains hopeful that the situation may change.\n\nEuropean Ryder Cup legends, Garcia, Poulter and Westwood are also hopeful they will be allowed to take part in future events. Rory McIlroy has ruled out joining the LIV series but believes those that do compete should not be disqualified from Ryder Cup selection.\n\nEach of the four majors are independently run and can decide whether LIV golfers can participate in their competitions. The USGA confirmed on Tuesday that those teeing it up at the Centurion Club that have already qualified for next week's US Open - which is live on Sky Sports from June 16 - will be allowed to take part.\n\nReports first began to surface of a rival league to the PGA Tour as far back as 2019, but it was only in late 2021 that the proposal truly began to take shape with the formation of LIV Golf Investments.\n\nThis new entity, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) - owners of Newcastle United - as its majority shareholder, made an initial $200m commitment to the Asian Tour, later increased to $300m, and appointed former world No 1 and Open champion Greg Norman as its CEO.\n\nIn March, despite the PGA Tour threatening to hand out lifetime bans to players who defect to a rival league, LIV Golf announced the schedule for an eight-event, $225m invitational series beginning at Centurion Club in St Albans on Thursday.\n\nLIV is the Roman numeral for 54, which is the number of holes to be played in each event. It also refers to the lowest score a player can shoot were they to birdie every hole on a par-72 course.\n\nDue to the PIF's links to the Saudi government, with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman serving as chairman, LIV Golf has faced accusations of sports washing.\n\nNorman has adamantly denied such claims, telling Sky Sports in May that Saudi Arabia is \"changing their culture within their country\" and insisting \"I do not answer to Saudi Arabia. I do not answer to their government or MBS\".\n\nComments from a Mickelson interview with author Alan Shipnuck, who is writing an unauthorised biography of the six-time major winner, came to light in February, in which the 51-year-old questioned Saudi Arabia's human rights record and called the regime \"scary\".\n\nMickelson has since apologised for his \"reckless\" comments.\n\nAll 48 players compete against each other in a traditional stroke play format, with the lowest 54-hole total from the no-cut event being the winner, while a draft will help allocate players into the team format.\n\nEach team will have a LIV appointed team captain who will select their three open team positions via a snake draft format, similar to those used on the Ladies European Tour in the Aramco Team Series.\n\nFor the first two rounds, the best two stroke play scores will count for each team. For the third and final round, the best three scores will count, with the lowest overall team score after 54 holes being named the team winner.\n\nThe format changes in the Team Championship, which is a seeded four-day, four-round, match play knock-out tournament. The top four seeds automatically receive a bye through the first round, with the remaining eight teams playing against each other to see who reaches the quarter-finals.\n\nCaptains in bold, with the 48-strong field divided into 12 teams\n\nThe first seven events all have a prize purse of $25million, with $20m being distributed between the 48-man field and the remaining $5m being shared between the top three teams at the end of each week.\n\nThe winner will receive $4m (\u00a33.2m), considerably more than the $2.7m awarded to Scottie Scheffler for his victory at The Masters and Justin Thomas secured for his PGA Championship success, while every player is guaranteed at least $120,000 just for completing 54 holes.\n\nAn Individual Champion will be crowned at the end of those events, with a $30m fund distributed for the top three players of the season, providing they have played in a minimum of four tournaments.\n\nThe prize purse doubles for the season finale in Miami and sees $50m allocated between each of the 12 four-man teams. Each player receives a 25 per cent cut of team earnings, with $16m awarded to the winning team and $1million for the team finishing 12th.\n\nThe inaugural event in London is the first of eight tournaments due to take place over the next few months, including five in the United States and two in Asia, with an expanded schedule then planned in the coming years.\n\nPumpkin Ridge GC in Portland from June 30-July 2 and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster from July 29-31 are the next two events, with further US-based tournaments take place in Boston from September 2-4 and Chicago from September 16-18.\n\nStonehill Golf Club in Bangkok is the venue from October 7-9 and Royal Greens Golf Club - the site of the Saudi International in recent years - hosts the following week, with the season-ending Team Championship then hosted at Trump National Doral Miami from October 27-30.\n\nLIV Golf plans to have 10 events in its 2023 calendar before expanding to 14 tournaments from 2024, although dates and locations for those have not yet been confirmed.\n\n\"We have a long-term vision and we're here to stay,\" said Norman, the CEO and commissioner of LIV Golf, via a release. \"We're going to grow the game, give more opportunities to players, and create a more entertaining product for fans.\"",

Both have had failed marriages with the current one being their fourth, and they live with their children \u2014 the ever-analytical Heinrich (Sam Nivola), a sensitive daughter named Steffie (May Nivola), sharp 11-year-old Denise (Raffey Cassidy) and a\u00a0beaming cherub named Wilder\u00a0make up the curios pack.\n\nDeLillo\u2019s humorous and loud novel was sought after by moviemakers for decades. However, Baumbach pipped many to the post by turning in a lovely adaptation of the chaotic novel.\n\nThe work resonates with the era of COVID-19 as depression, fear, fake news and television conspiracies take hold in a film that features a host of beautifully fleshed out supporting characters played by the likes of Jodie Turner-Smith, Andr\u00e9 L. Benjamin,\u00a0New York theatre director Sam Gold and\u00a0Don Cheadle, who gives\u00a0a fantastic intellectual caricature of a college professor.\n\nA charming work \u2014 and Baumbach\u2019s third for Netflix \u2014 it does begin to feel a tad stretched as it moves along. The conspiracy theories and early anxiety about death, as well as a tangent focusing on Babette\u2019s addiction to an experimentative drug, all seem to pull \u201cWhite Noise\u201d in too many directions and the lack of focus is troubling. But Driver\u2019s wonderful performance is a great lift as he essays a man plagued by one issue after another.",

      "text": "Acting is said to have originated in Egypt as early as 4000 B. C. when priests worshiped the memory of the departed. In China, keeping alive the memory of the victory of the current emperor\u2019s ancestors over its predecessor paved the way for the development of the first nonreligious acting.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the forms of acting occurred with drama plays. Early actors used a mask to portray several characters in one play. They made the body express through mime what the face could not. Meanwhile, the Roman Empire\u2019s theatrical plays were filled with spectacle and diversity.\n\nThe Middle Ages, with its season of Catholic influence, attempted to label acting as a dangerous, immoral, and pagan art form, which lowered its popularity immensely. The Renaissance period then brought acting back and transformed it again with morality plays. This was followed by William Shakespeare in the 1700s, who solidified theater acting in its place.\n\nItaly was the birthplace of modern professional acting in the West during the early 16th century. Actors invented words and actions to breathe life into scenarios, teaching actors to collaborate. Even so, the weight is still on an individual actor\u2019s skills and cleverness.\n\nSince then, acting has evolved into a highly respected art form. Famous actors from all over the world play characters from books, plays, and scripts, and then convey those characters through Broadway shows, theater plays, and films.",

      "text": "A gang of armed robbers have been jailed for a total of 141 years after a wave of violent attacks on security guards refilling cash machines.\n\nThey used guns, knives, hammers and crowbars to terrorise staff before fleeing in a fleet of stolen vehicles and leaving few clues behind them.\n\nWhen banknotes got stained by security dye, they laundered the cash through fixed-odds betting terminals in bookmakers' shops.\n\nThey took advantage of a system that allowed punters to load a machine with up to \u00a33,000 cash, make one small bet and then collect their unspent stake in fresh notes from the shop's cash till.\n\nThey burnt piles of stained banknotes and a car that got sprayed when they smashed open one cash box and triggered the dye security system.\n\nProsecutor Kenneth Millett said: \"There was a degree of professionalism, planning and organisation involved, a degree of split-second timing and violence used.\"\n\nArmed police ambushed two robbers - Abdi Omar and Brooklyn McFarlane - as they were about to attack security guards at a local Sainsbury's in Wimbledon, south west London.\n\nOmar was caught quickly, while McFarlane ran and pulled a knife and was shot by police who believed he was carrying a gun. He was discharged from hospital the next day.\n\nTwo firearms officers were charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent, but the charges were later dropped. They are now facing a disciplinary hearing for alleged gross misconduct.\n\nThe gang were caught after an astonishing bit of detective work by the Metropolitan Police's Flying Squad who, from poor quality CCTV footage, managed to identify and track one of their stolen cars and the first of the robbers who eventually led them to the rest.\n\nDetective Superintendent Simon Moring said: \"They had a well-organised gang structure. They displayed a really good tradecraft, using stolen vehicles, cloned number plates, they knew a lot about police tactics, used good anti-surveillance techniques, so that they knew what they were doing. They were a forceful gang.\n\n\"The violence was extreme, security guards thrown around, hit with iron bars, guns held to their heads. Thankfully no one got seriously hurt. They would have just carried on committing robberies and who knows where and how it would have ended.\"\n\nThe gang attacked guards at cash points in London, Oxford, Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire, usually congregating and travelling from an estate in south London.\n\nArmed with loaded handguns and other weapons they wore ballistic body armour and balaclavas. Over 18 months they stole more than \u00a3400,000.\n\nTwo robbers arrested after crashing into bus\n\nThe first two robbers identified were arrested after jumping a red light and crashing into a bus. They ran off but were chased and caught by a team of detectives who were trailing them.\n\nWhile awaiting trial the two shared a cell in Wandsworth prison and police later discovered they had a smuggled mobile phone and used it to coordinate more robberies committed by those yet to be caught.\n\nIn the first of two trials Basil Abdul-Latif, 36, from south London, the gang's leader, was jailed for 22 years for conspiracies to rob, possess a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and handle stolen goods and arson.\n\nA second main gang member David Tesfaalem, 30, from South London, was jailed for 20 years for similar offences.\n\nIbrahim Lyazi, 29, from west London, got 18 years and two others, Ihab Ashaoui, 30, and Adam Salman, 32, were each jailed for 14 years. Ola Orulebaja was jailed for 13 years.\n\nDetective Constable Stephen O'Connell from the Flying Squad said: \"This was an immensely complex investigation involving a huge amount of evidence. The group caused havoc in and outside London with buildings being severely damaged and high-value goods being stolen.\n\n\"These men have since discovered that crime does not pay and thanks to the complex investigative work by the Flying Squad they will instead be spending time behind bars. Investigations continue to track down and bring to justice outstanding suspects who are believed to be involved in these offences.\"\n\nFour other men, all from south London, were convicted in a second trial for their roles in the robbery conspiracy.\n\nBrooklyn McFarlane, 27, described as a ringleader, was jailed for 13 years for conspiracy to rob, threatening a security guard, possessing a knife and crowbar and handling stolen cars.\n\nAbdi Omar, 27, got nine years for conspiracy to rob, possessing an offensive weapon and handling a stolen car. Mahdi Hashi, 29, and Noaman Amin, 26, were both jailed for nine years for conspiracy to rob and threatening a guard.",

      "text": "MAKKAH \u2014 Deputy Minister of Hajj and Umrah Dr. Abdulfattah bin Sulaiman Mashat has identified four main areas for volunteering to serve Hajj and Umrah pilgrims.\n\nThe four areas are reception and farewell, translation and guidance, field activities, and health.\n\nDr. Mashat revealed the volunteering tracks during his participation in a session entitled \u201cThe Impact of Social Responsibility\" within the activities of Misk Tour, which is being held at the King Salman International Conference Center in Madinah. The event is sponsored by Prince Faisal bin Salman, Emir of the Madinah Region.\n\nThe target of one million volunteers by 2030, as per the goals of Saudi Vision 2030, is doable and can be achieved before 2030, Dr. Mashat confirmed.\n\nHe added that this can be achieved through the governance of charitable work, creating various volunteer programs and activities, providing discretionary incentives to encourage volunteering, and highlighting the role of volunteers.\n\nDr. Mashat pointed out the difference between volunteering and social responsibility regarding sustainability, governance, and commitment. He called on young people who are wishing to engage in volunteering to choose sectors that align with their specializations and tastes to reduce the wastage of resources.\n\nHe touched on the \"Be Helpful\" voluntary program, one of the initiatives of the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, and its role in providing services to pilgrims.\n\nAdditionally, the ministry's role in supporting stranded pilgrims during the Covid-19 pandemic and the closure of airports, shops and public places to evacuate more than 400,000 pilgrims, in partnership with non-profit organizations to provide services such as housing, awareness, logistics and support services, without registering any cases of coronavirus infection.\n\nDr. Mashat referred to the social responsibility programs that the Ministry is carrying out to facilitate the journey of pilgrims with special needs.\n\nHe highlighted the patterns of the quality of social responsibility work by enhancing the use of experience, knowledge, and capabilities in providing social responsibility work to influence the individual and society, through professional participation, consultancy, and community leadership.\n\nHe also explained the role of government institutions in transferring the culture of social responsibility, and rooting the principle of responsible community, and establishing governance within the government institutions to measure impact.",

[It\u2019s been] three months, we\u2019re going to see a lot of interesting haircuts.\u201d\n\nAl Salman wasn\u2019t nervous about catching Covid-19, as all his colleagues were vaccinated. However, he was nervous about there being a case at the salon and possibly having to temporarily close.\n\nBarber shops and hairdressers are allowed to open after 100 days of lockdown in Auckland.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to live with it now.\u201d\n\nSteph Hosking, the co-owner of Luxe & Duke hairdressers in Grey Lynn and Wynyard Quarter, said her teams were \u201cquite excited\u201d to get back to work.\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty exciting to get the doors open and see all our lovley clients.\"\n\nHosking anticipated the next few weeks would be a \u201ccrazy time\u201d with the rush to get through three months\u2019 worth of missed appointments so close to Christmas.\n\nLuxe and Duke Hairdressing co-owner Steph Hosking, left, said it would be a \u201cmammoth task\u201d getting through three months\u2019 worth of missed appointments before Christmas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mammoth task.\u201d\n\nIt had been a big job getting everything ready for Thursday, including giving the salons a good clean, restocking hair products and working out how to manage scanning vaccine certificates with the verifier app.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you just open and start cutting hair, there\u2019s quite a lot of prep.\u201d\n\nAt one point following the announcement that hairdressers could operate, Hosking looked at her phone and had about 70 missed calls and texts from clients wanting to rebook appointments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more popular in [my] life.\u201d\n\nAsked what services were in demand, Hosking said the men just wanted their hair cut, while the women wanted \u201clots of colour\u201d, rather than touch-ups.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s having the full works. People are really looking forward to having that done and not using box dye at home.\u201d\n\nAsked what it was like using the Covid-19 vaccine passport verifier app, Hosking said she wished it could be set up on the salon front-facing iPad so that customers could scan it themselves, similar to scanning the Covid tracer app QR codes.\n\nFMK Hair Design in Onehunga expects to see around 25 clients today, with some services taking up to three hours.\n\nCurrently, the app only allows business owners to use their device\u2019s back camera to scan the vaccine certificates.\n\nKerry Rodger was at the salon to have her hair shampooed and trimmed, and her head massaged.\n\nShe said it was \u201ca treat\u201d to finally have her hair done by a professional, as her husband had been trimming her hair during lockdown.\n\n\u201cIt's really special. It's lovely after all this time.\u201d\n\nKatie Hunt travelled from Glenfield to get a keratin treatment at FMK Hair Design in Onehunga early on Thursday morning.\n\nFMK Hair Design Onehunga director Elnaz Jahanrakshan said the salon\u2019s phone had blown up with appointment inquiries shortly after the Government announcement on Monday.\n\nThere were five stylists working in the salon on Thursday. Each would see between four and five customers, with some appointments taking around three hours.\n\nMost of their clients were in for a keratin treatment, to straighten their hair and reduce frizz, a cut or colour.\n\n\u201cEverybody just wants to look great for summer.\u201d\n\nJahanrakshan said using the Covid-19 vaccine passport app had been \u201csuper easy\u201d.\n\n\"Everyone\u2019s coming in prepared to show us their vaccine passports, and we have our scanners ready to go.\"\n\nKatie Hunt, who travelled to the salon from Glenfield on the North Shore, felt \u201cvery lucky\u201d to have scored one of the first appointments for a keratin treatment, at 8.15am.\n\nShe said her hair was \u201cfrizzy\u201d, and \u201cdefinitely\u201d needed it after lockdown.\n\nThe use of Covid-19 vaccine certificates will be rolled out nationally when the country transitions to the traffic light framework on December 3.",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",

The protesters including women and children showed their solidarity with Khan during the rally that started at 9 pm on Sunday and lasted till 3 am on Monday.",

The House vote came a day after the Senate, also led by Democrats, voted 68-29 to pass the bill with significantly more Republican support.Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, argued during floor debate that the bill spends too much and does too little to curb illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. from Mexico.\u201cThis is a monstrosity that is one of the most shameful acts I\u2019ve ever seen in this body,\u201d McCarthy said of the legislation.The funding bill includes a roughly six percent increase in spending for domestic initiatives, to $772.5 billion.

It is a conflict that has had major repercussions around the world, with millions of refugees prompting a cost of living crisis with soaring energy and food bills as well as millions of refugees fleeing Ukraine.When Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24, President Putin's 'special military operation' set in motion the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War.The United Nations estimates that 7.8 million Ukrainians, mainly women and children have crossed into Europe.Some have since returned but 4.7m remain registered for temporary protection putting extreme economic and humanitarian pressure on host countries. Poland alone has almost 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees.The conflict has also contributed to spiralling inflation and a cost of living crisis around the world.Before the conflict around 40 percent of Europe's gas supplies came from Russia.In response to western sanctions, Russia has reduced gas supplies to a trickle, forcing energy prices on the international market to shoot up to record levels.This has led to spiralling inflation and a cost of living crisis, forcing many European countries to spend billions of dollars to help support both domestic and business users.\n\nUkrainian service members attend military exercises near the border with Belarus, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Zhytomyr region, Ukraine December 27, 2022.

Reuters/Viacheslav Ratynskyi\n\nThe major energy suppliers, the big multinational oil giants, are doing well from the crisis posting record multi-billion dollar profits from the higher energy prices.But on December 27 President Putin also banned export of Russian oil to countries imposing a price cap.The energy crisis, though, has given added impetus to expanding renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power and rethink fossil fuel projects.The war's impact is also being felt in the developing world, especially in parts of Africa and Asia which were heavily reliant on grain shipments from Ukraine.Historically Ukraine is one of the world's leading grain producers but with the Black Sea infested with both Russian and Ukrainian mines, grain shipments came to a halt.Much of Ukraine's 2021 harvest was still in storage and the 2022 harvest risked being left to rot. Ukraine did manage to get some grain out by train via Poland and barge via Romania but volumes were low and the costs high.With famine looming in parts of drought stricken East Africa, the pressure was on to find a solution.Finally in July, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, along with Turkey managed to negotiate an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to allow grain shipments to resume, helping to avert famine and ease the global food crisis.Renewed for 3 more months in November, it's the only diplomatic breakthrough of the war.Despite the cost of living crisis, Europe, the United States and NATO are united in their support of Ukraine, providing substantial military and economic aid. In a potential flashpoint with Russia, NATO is pushing ahead with membership for Finland and Sweden.The conflict has also left Russia more isolated on the international stage facing widespread sanctions. Several oligarchs have had their mega-yachts confiscated and bank accounts frozen.In October the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly not to recognise the four Ukrainian provinces it has tried to annex. Just five countries, including Russia voted against the motion.Then in late November the European Parliament declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.This conflict has so far remained within Russia and Ukraine, although a recent stray missile that landed in Poland killing two people was a stark reminder of how volatile the situation is.Had this been a deliberate Russian attack, NATO might have entered the conflict potentially sparking World War 3.It was avoided this time, the strike was an accident but the longer the war continues the risk of escalation remains.\n\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar and Intelligence Chief Hakan Fidan have made a surprise visit to Moscow for various meetings, Anadolu Agency reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe CEO of Russian gas giant Gazprom, Alexei Miller, said on Wednesday that the company has started working on a gas hub project in T\u00fcrkiye.The gas hub will ensure transparent and fair pricing in the natural gas market, Miller said during a conference call.\n\nRussia has expelled Lithuanian diplomat in a retaliatory move, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.\n\nKremlin: 'Peace plan' has to account for new regions joining Russia\n\nThe Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed peace plan proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\"There can be no peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account today's realities regarding Russian territory, with the entry of four regions into Russia,\" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday Kyiv is counting on holding a summit to discuss the peace plan by the end of February.\n\nAir raid warnings have been issued across Ukraine, local media reported on Wednesday.\n\nAir raid alerts were sounded in several Ukrainian regions on Wednesday, including capital Kyiv, local media said.\n\nBlinken pledges continuous help to Ukraine on energy infrastructure\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken on Tuesday vowed to offer continuous help to Ukraine on energy infrastructure amid harsh winter in show of support to Kyiv.\"We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.

The U.N. spokesman's office had no immediate comment.When asked about whether Ukraine will invite Russia to participate in the summit, Kuleba said Moscow would first need to face prosecution for war crimes at an international court before his country directly talks with Moscow. He also dismissed Putin's recent calls for negotiations, stating that everything Russia does on the battlefield \"proves the opposite\".Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed a few days ago that his country is ready for talks to end the war in Ukraine, but suggested that the Ukrainians are the ones refusing to take that step.Despite Putin's comments and Ukraine mulling a peace summit, their fighting on the battlefield and in the air has never ceased, a sign that peace isn't imminent.Kuleba said Ukraine will do whatever it can to win the war in 2023, but admitted that diplomacy plays an important role.\"Every war ends in a diplomatic way,\" he said. \"Every war ends as a result of the actions taken on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.\"\n\nUkrainian soldiers prepare to fire a French-made CAESAR self-propelled howitzer towards Russian positions near Avdiivka, Donetsk region, December 26, 2022. /CFP\n\nUkrainian soldiers prepare to fire a French-made CAESAR self-propelled howitzer towards Russian positions near Avdiivka, Donetsk region, December 26, 2022. /CFP\n\nRussia gave ultimatum, calling on Ukraine to fulfil its proposalsCommenting on Kuleba's proposal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the state RIA Novosti news agency that Russia \"never followed conditions set by others.

And, according to Kuleba, the aid also includes a U.S. program for Ukrainian troops to complete training faster than usual \u201cwithout any damage to the quality of the use of this weapon on the battlefield.\u201d And he added that the training will be done outside Ukraine.Russia has long been criticizing the U.S. aid to Ukraine and saying it pushes an anti-Russia agenda. Lavrov on Monday reiterated that Washington's attempts to preserve its complete ideological hegemony, establish irrevocable dominance and suppress the formation of multi-polar world order will eventually fail.\"Everything that we are currently seeing in Europe... everything that we are seeing on other continents, where U.S. messengers are demanding every state to adopt an anti-Russian position, join sanctions, and stop communication with Russian representatives, all this is a reflection of that very attempt to establish the end of history,\" Lavrov was quoted by TASS news agency as saying.He added that in the near future, the West will have less leverage and reduced opportunity when it comes to \"steering the global economy,\" and will be forced to negotiate with other countries.\n\nAir alarm was sounded in several Ukrainian regions on Tuesday, local media reported.\n\nUkraine conflict - day 306: Three die as drone shot down at airbase deep inside Russia\n\n\u00b7 Russia said it had shot down a Ukrainian drone close to Engels airbase, in Saratov, south east of Moscow, which is used for long-range bombers and that three Russian air force personnel had been killed by debris.

No planes were damaged in the incident, the defense ministry said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.Unverified Russian and Ukrainian social media accounts reported that a number of planes had been destroyed.The air base, one of two strategic bomber bases housing Russia's air-delivered nuclear capability, is located near the city of Saratov, about 450 miles southeast of Moscow and hundreds of miles from the frontlines in Ukraine.There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, which has never publicly claimed responsibility for attacks inside Russia but calls them \"karma\" for Russia's attacks.The same base was attacked earlier this month by Ukrainian drones, Russia said at the time.\"A Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) was shot down at low altitude while approaching the Engels military airfield in the Saratov region,\" the defense ministry statement, published on Monday, said.\"Three Russian servicemen of the technical staff who were at the airfield were fatally wounded as a result of falling drone wreckage.\"Russia has 60 to 70 strategic bomber planes of two types - the Tu-95MS Bear and the Tu-160 Blackjack.

Kyiv has said such attacks amount to war crimes and has likened Russia to a terrorist state.The earlier December 5 strike on the same base, along with another attack the same day on another base, raised questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defenses and shocked Russian commentators.If Ukraine could strike that far inside Russia, it may also be capable of hitting Moscow, they said on social media.Earlier on Monday, Roman Busargin, governor of the Saratov region, said that civil infrastructure facilities had not been damaged in the latest incident at the base, which he said the authorities were investigating.\"There is absolutely no threat to residents ...

In August, gas prices in Europe briefly soared to nearly 340 euros per MWH, rattling EU governments. Though it has since fallen, but remains historically high.Ministers agreed to trigger a cap if prices exceed 180 euros ($191.11) per MWH for three days on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub's front-month contract, which serves as the European benchmark. The TTF price must also be 35 euros per MWH higher than a reference price based on existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) price assessments for three days.This arrangement tries to cap the price at which gas can be traded, and at the same time allow the capped level to fluctuate alongside global LNG prices, a system designed to ensure EU countries can still bid at competitive prices for gas in from global markets.Germany voted to support the deal, despite having raised concerns about the policy's impact on Europe's ability to attract gas supplies in price-competitive global markets, three EU officials said.An EU official told Reuters Germany agreed to the price cap after countries agreed changes to another regulation on speeding up renewable energy permits, and stronger safeguards were added to the cap.Those safeguards include that the cap will be suspended if the EU faces a gas supply shortage, or if the cap causes a drop in TTF trading, a jump in gas use or a significant increase in gas market participants' margin calls.\n\nPipes and pressure gauges for gas lines are pictured at Open Grid Europe (OGE), one of Europe's largest gas transmission system operators, in Werne, western Germany, July 15, 2022. /CFP\n\nPipes and pressure gauges for gas lines are pictured at Open Grid Europe (OGE), one of Europe's largest gas transmission system operators, in Werne, western Germany, July 15, 2022. /CFP\n\nIn Monday's meeting, Hungary voted against the price cap. The Netherlands and Austria abstained. Both had resisted the cap during negotiations, fearing it could disrupt Europe's energy markets and compromise Europe's energy security.Dutch energy minister Rob Jetten said: \"Despite progress the last couple of weeks, the market correction mechanism remains potentially unsafe.\"\"I remain worried about major disruptions on the European energy market, about the financial implications and, most of all, I am worried about European security of supply,\" he added.The EU proposal has also drawn opposition from some market participants, who have said it could cause financial instability.The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which hosts TTF trading on its Amsterdam exchange, last week said it could move TTF trading to outside of the EU if the bloc capped prices. On Monday, it said it will assess whether it can continue to operate fair and orderly markets for TTF gas hub trading. For now, ICE TTF markets will continue trading as normal.Italy's energy authority ARERA expects further increases in gas prices as the winter season kicks in, its President Stefano Besseghini said on Monday.Meanwhile, Russia's Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the cap was an attack on market pricing, and unacceptable, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.\"This is a violation of the market price-setting, an infringement on market processes, any reference to a (price) cap is unacceptable,\"the Kremlin spokesman was cited as saying.In acknowledgement of overall concerns among EU member countries, EU energy commissioner Kadri Simsonsaid the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the bloc's Agency for the Cooperation of Energy (ACER) would present a \"data report\" on the likely consequences of the unprecedented price cap before it takes effect, adding if an analysis shows that the risks outweigh the benefits, the\u201cCommission stands ready to suspend ex-ante the activation of the mechanism.\u201dFrance's energy minister, Agnes Pannier-Runacher, said that, with the price cap agreed, attention must now turn to a longer-term reform of the EU's energy market, notably unhitching the price of gas from that of electricity.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday held talks with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk, RIA news agency reported.\n\nFirefighters work at a site of a critical power infrastructure site, which was hit during Russia's drones attacks on Kyiv. /State Emergency Service of Ukraine /Reuters\n\nFirefighters work at a site of a critical power infrastructure site, which was hit during Russia's drones attacks on Kyiv. /State Emergency Service of Ukraine /Reuters\n\n\u00b7 Drones attacked Kyiv days after the Ukrainian capital withstood one of the biggest missile attacks since the start of the conflict. \"During the air alert, 23 enemy Unmanned Aerial Vehicles were recorded in the sky above the capital.

The Patriot would be the most advanced surface-to-air missile system the West has provided to Ukraine to help repel Russian aerial attacks.The former Russian President and current Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev has warned NATO against equipping Kyiv with Patriot missile defenses, and it is likely the Kremlin will view the move as an escalation, Reuters reported.\n\nU.S. about to send Patriot defense system to Ukraine: officials\n\nThe United States is finalizing plans to send the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine, a decision that could be announced as soon as this week, three U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday.Ukraine has asked its Western partners for air defenses, including U.S.-made Patriot systems, to protect it from Russian missile bombardment.Ground-based air defense systems, such as Raytheon Technology Corp's Patriot, are built to intercept incoming missiles.The Patriot is considered to be one of the most advanced U.S. air defense systems and is usually in short supply, with allies around the world vying for it.\"It's very, very significant,\" said Alexander Vindman, a retired army lieutenant colonel who led Ukraine policy at the White House during the administration of President Donald Trump.The Patriot system is usually used against more advanced threats including aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles and typically includes launchers along with radar and other support vehicles.Two of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the announcement could come as early as Thursday but was awaiting formal approval from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and President Joe Biden.The Pentagon declined comment on reports about the Patriot system at a news briefing.There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian officials, but Kyiv held high-level military talks on Tuesday with Washington, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said.One of the officials said Ukrainian forces would likely be trained in Germany before the Patriot equipment was sent to Ukraine. Vindman said the training could take several months.Details such as the version of the Patriot missile defense system, its range or how many units would be sent were not immediately available.It was unclear if the United States would limit how the Ukrainians employ the Patriot system.

The Ukrainian military 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System launchers, known as HIMARS, are a sizable stock of satellite-guided rockets with a nearly 50-mile range. These rocket systems have been employed to attack Russian command posts, logistics hubs, and munitions storage facilities on Ukrainian territory.The report claimed that the U.S. has not provided Ukraine with long-range Army Tactical Missile System rockets, or ATACMS missiles, which have a range of approximately 200 miles (about 322 kilometers). The modified HIMARS would prevent Ukrainian forces from launching ATACMS if obtained from another source.The WSJ also reported that the modifications reflect concerns among officials in the Joe Biden administration that their Ukrainian partner would stop upholding its pledge not to attack Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons. The Biden administration has gone to strike a balance between its backing for the Ukrainian military and possible escalation with Moscow.So far, no political talks are under way to end the conflict.

Oil prices have dropped since October due to slower Chinese and global growth and higher interest rates, prompting speculation the group could reduce output again.However, on Sunday the oil producers agreed to keep the policy unchanged. Its key ministers will next meet again on February 1 for a monitoring committee, with a full meeting set to take place on June 3 and 4.On Friday, G7 nations and Australia agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil, a bid to block Russian revenue while still keeping Moscow's oil flowing to global markets.The Kremlin said it would not sell its oil under the cap and was considering how to respond.\n\nMany analysts and OPEC ministers have said the price cap is probably inefficient as Moscow is now selling most of its oil to countries like China and India.Neither an OPEC meeting on Saturday nor the OPEC+ meeting on Sunday discussed the Russian price cap, sources said.However, several OPEC+ members reportedly expressed frustration at the agreement, saying the anti-market measure could ultimately be used by the West against any producer.\n\nEU must adjust laws on public investment to tackle U.S. climate plan 'distortions', says bloc chief\n\nEU chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU had to work with the U.S. to address \"some of the most concerning aspects of the law.\" /Paul Faith/AFP\n\nEU chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU had to work with the U.S. to address \"some of the most concerning aspects of the law.\" /Paul Faith/AFP\n\nEuropean Union chief Ursula von der Leyen has said the bloc will have to act to combat \"distortions\" created by Washington's $430 billion plan to heavily subsidize climate-friendly technologies in the U.S.The EU must \"take action to rebalance the playing field where the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) or other measures create distortions,\" Von der Leyen said in a speech at the College of Europe in the Belgian city of Bruges on Sunday.EU countries have hit out on Washington's landmark Inflation Reduction Act, claiming that its inclusion of state subsidies is \"anti-competitive\" and a threat to European jobs, particularly in the energy and auto sectors.The act, designed to push forward the U.S. transition to a low-carbon economy, includes around $370 billion in subsidies for green energy. It also will see tax cuts for U.S.-made electric cars and batteries.\u00a0The family with six generations of UK-China tradingVon der Leyen said the EU had to work with the U.S. to address what she called \"some of the most concerning aspects of the law.\"She added that Brussels must also \"adjust\" its own laws to allow for public investment in the environmental transition and \"re-assess the need for further European funding of the transition.\"French President Emmanuel Macron used the opportunity of his state visit to the U.S. to air his grievances over U.S.-EU trade.The White House says the IRA is a groundbreaking effort to reignite U.S. manufacturing and promote renewable technologies.\n\nUncertainty in global oil market with EU's price cap on Russian oil\n\nAn OPEC sign is seen on the day of OPEC+ meeting in Vienna, Austria. /Reuters\n\nAn OPEC sign is seen on the day of OPEC+ meeting in Vienna, Austria. /Reuters\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) agreed to stick to its oil output targets at a virtual meeting on Sunday.The decision comes two days after the Group of Seven (G7) nations and Australia agreed to cap the price of Russian seaborne crude oil at $60 a barrel.The price cap aims to limit Russia's income from selling oil and prevent a spike in global oil prices. It is set to take effect on December 5, the same day that the EU will impose a boycott on most Russian crude.Under the price cap, non-EU countries can continue to import Russian crude, but shipping, insurance and reinsurance companies are not allowed to handle cargoes of Russian crude around the globe, if it is sold at a price above that threshold.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that the price cap would largely reduce Russia's revenues, as well as help to stabilize global energy prices and benefit emerging economies globally.Russia says it won't accept an oil price cap and is preparing a response.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed that the country had made preparations for the price cap by G7 nations, the EU and Australia, the Russian state news agency TASS reported.Meanwhile, Kirill Melnikov, head of the Energy Development Center, told TASS that the global oil price could exceed $100 amid the introduction of the price cap. Other analysts said the EU is jeopardizing its own energy security.\"Starting from this year Europe will live without Russian oil,\" said Mikhail Ulyanov, Moscow's ambassador to international organizations in Vienna on Twitter on Saturday.\"Moscow has already made it clear that it will not supply oil to those countries who support anti-market price cap. Very soon the EU will blame Russia for using oil as a weapon,\" he said.\n\nA view shows the crude oil terminal Kozmino on the shore of Nakhodka Bay near the port city of Nakhodka, Russia, August 12, 2022. /Reuters\n\nA view shows the crude oil terminal Kozmino on the shore of Nakhodka Bay near the port city of Nakhodka, Russia, August 12, 2022. /Reuters\n\nEU countries have disputed for days over the issue of putting a price cap on Russian crude oil, as Poland, Lithuania and Estonia rejected the higher price of $65-70 per barrel, saying it cannot effectively reduce Russia's revenue from oil import.In early October, OPEC+ agreed to reduce production by 2 million barrels per day, about 2 percent of world demand, from November until the end of 2023. The decision came even though the U.S. has been calling OPEC+ to produce more to lower the oil price.\"The price cap will encourage the flow of discounted Russian oil onto global markets and is designed to help protect consumers and businesses from global supply disruptions,\" said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen in a statement on December 2nd.It will particularly benefit low- and medium-income countries who have already borne the brunt of elevated energy and food prices, she added.The U.S. joined European allies to impose economic sanctions on Russia, after the crisis escalated when Russia launched a \"special military operation\" in February.In comments published on Telegram, Russia's embassy in the U.S. criticized the price cap as a \"dangerous\" move, saying Moscow would continue to find buyers for its oil.Russia, the world's second-largest oil producer, has shifted much of its supply to Asian countries.Analysts are concerned about the uncertainty in the global oil market in the next period.With the global economy slowing down, oil prices have been falling in recent months. However, the two measures including the price cap and EU boycott on Russian crude could \"take an unknown amount of Russian oil off the global market\", wrote AP Business Writers, adding that it will tighten supply and drive up prices.Analysts at Commerzbank also say that the EU embargo and cap together could result in \"a noticeable tightening on the oil market in early 2023.\"However, other experts said a $60 cap will not have much impact on Russia's finances.The price cap \"will almost go unnoticed,\" as it would be near where Russian oil is already selling, Simone Tagliapietra, an energy policy expert at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels told AP.\"Up front, the cap is not a satisfying number,\" said Tagliapietra, adding that at least it could restrain Russia from profiting if the oil price spikes.\n\nUkraine conflict \u2013 day 284: Macron says West should address Russia security demands in peace talks\n\nA Ukrainian soldier helps his comrade to drink in Donetsk's Bakhmut, which Russian forces are allegedly planning to encircle. /Anatolii Stepanov/AFP\n\nA Ukrainian soldier helps his comrade to drink in Donetsk's Bakhmut, which Russian forces are allegedly planning to encircle. /Anatolii Stepanov/AFP\n\n\u00b7 French President Emmanuel Macron has said the West should consider Russia's need for security guarantees, including fears that \"NATO comes right up to its doors,\" if his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiations about ending the Ukraine war.

Ukraine says negotiations are possible only if Russia pulls out all of its troops from the country.Many in Ukraine and the West are strongly opposed to any negotiation with Putin if they include any concessions after nearly 10 months of war, especially as Ukraine has made gains against Russian forces in the past three months.But Macron's comments suggest he is sympathetic to Moscow's need for security guarantees \u2013 a demand Moscow says the West failed to address in the run-up to the war.On February 8, just weeks before Russia's attack on Ukraine, Putin said at a joint news conference with Macron in Moscow that Russia would keep trying to obtain answers from the West to its main security demands: no more NATO enlargement; no missile deployments near its borders; and a scaling back of NATO's military infrastructure in Europe to 1997 levels.The U.S. said at the time that Moscow's demands were \"non-starters.\"\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, on Sunday agreed to stick to its oil output target against the backdrop of sliding crude prices and an imminent Western countries' price cap on Russian oil.According to a statement released after the 34th OPEC+ ministerial meeting, the oil-producer alliance decided to reaffirm the decision of its previous ministerial meeting in early October, where it agreed to cut production by two million barrels per day from November until the end of 2023.The production cut equals about 2 percent of this year's global oil demand.In Sunday's statement, OPEC+ defended its output cut decision in October, saying it \"was purely driven by market considerations and recognized in retrospect by the market participants to have been the necessary and the right course of action towards stabilizing global oil markets.\"The United States and other Western countries have accused OPEC+ of pushing up oil prices and fueling inflation after its production cut decision in October, whereas OPEC+ has insisted that the cut was made to stabilize the oil market as crude prices had declined amid a weaker global economic outlook.OPEC+'s output rollover decision on Sunday was announced amid increasing uncertainties in the oil market, including weakening crude prices and an upcoming price cap on Russian oil imposed by the European Union (EU) and the Group of Seven (G7) countries.Despite OPEC+'s output cut in October, crude prices have continued to slide over growing fears of economic slowdown and demand destruction. Both the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and the Brent crude have hovered around $80 a barrel in recent weeks, far from their summer peaks of over $120 a barrel.The EU and the G7 on Friday agreed on a $60 per barrel cap on the price of Russian seaborne crude, which is expected to come into effect on Monday.Under the price cap, insurance, finance and other services for Russian oil shipments will be banned if oil sells for more than $60 a barrel.Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, said on Friday after the EU decision that \"starting from this year Europe will live without Russian oil\" as \"Moscow has already made it clear that it will not supply oil to those countries who support anti-market price cap.\"The OPEC+ countries on Sunday also decided to hold their next ministerial meeting on June 4 next year, but said they remain ready to \"meet at any time and take immediate additional measures to address market developments and support the balance of the oil market and its stability if necessary.\"\n\nRussia on Saturday denounced a $60 price cap on its oil agreed by the European Union, G7 and Australia, even as Ukraine suggested it was not tough enough and might have to be revisited.\u201cNow we are analyzing,\u201d\u00a0said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Russia Today (RT) reported on Saturday. \u201cSome preparation was carried out for such a ceiling. We will not accept this ceiling, and we will provide further information on how the work will be organized after the review.\u201dThe $60 oil price cap will come into effect on Monday or soon after, alongside an EU embargo on maritime deliveries of Russian crude oil.The embargo will prevent seaborne shipments of Russian crude to the EU, which account for two-thirds of the bloc's oil imports from Russia, potentially depriving Russia of billions of euros.Russia has repeatedly stated that it will not sell oil to nations that participate in the scheme, warning that the cap will wreak havoc on energy markets and push commodity prices even higher, according to RT.The G7 nations \u2013 Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 along with Australia have already said they are prepared to adjust the price ceiling if necessary.The cap stops countries from paying more than $60 a barrel for Russian oil deliveries\u00a0by tanker vessel and is designed to make it harder for Russia to bypass EU sanctions by selling beyond the EU at market prices.The market price of a barrel of Russian Urals crude is currently around $65, just slightly higher than the $60 cap agreed upon, suggesting the measure may have only a limited impact in the short term.\n\nRussia rejects oil price cap agreed by EU and G7, Ukraine says level of price cap isn't serious\n\nRussia has denounced the $60 price cap on its oil agreed by the EU, G7 and Australia. Russia said this was a \"dangerous\" attempt by Western governments to introduce a price cap on its oil exports. The Kremlin says Russia is \"analyzing\" how to respond, adding it would continue to find buyers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the level set was not \"serious\" as it would not do enough damage to the Russian economy.\n\nExpert: Russia's decision is critical to how EU copes with energy crisis\n\nThe price cap is considered one of the sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine conflict. Lin Boqiang, dean of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, said Russia's decision on whether or not to sell its oil would be critical to the energy market, and how Europe copes with its energy crisis.\n\nEU publishes decision on Russian oil price cap of $60 per barrel\n\nTanker trucks travel towards the TotalEnergies SE Grandpuits oil refinery in Grandpuits-Bailly-Carrois, France, December 1, 2022. /CFP\n\nTanker trucks travel towards the TotalEnergies SE Grandpuits oil refinery in Grandpuits-Bailly-Carrois, France, December 1, 2022. /CFP\n\nThe European Union (EU) published in its official journal the decision to cap the price of Russian oil at $60 per barrel shortly after member countries approved the move.\n\nThe cap will become applicable from December 5, 2022.The measure, an idea of the Group of Seven nations (G7), comes on top of the EU's embargo on imports of Russian seaborne crude that also kicks in on December 5, and is meant to allow oil-related services to third countries only for those cargoes below the cap.\"It will also help us to stabilize global energy prices, benefiting countries across the world who are currently confronted with high oil prices,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement.The price cap will prohibit G7 companies dealing with the insurance, re-insurance or financing of oil trade or to handle Russian crude oil cargoes to third countries unless the oil was sold at or below the $60 per barrel price cap.In response to the deal, the Kremlin said in comments reported on Saturday that Russia \"will not accept\" a price cap on its oil and is analyzing how to respond.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had made preparations for the price cap announcement by the G7, the EU and Australia, Russian news agency TASS reported.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday also criticized the price cap, calling it \"a weak position\" because it is not \"serious\" enough to destroy the Russian economy.From Monday, the EU itself will not be buying any Russian seaborne crude, which had made up 94 percent of all Russian crude imports by the 27-nation EU.The bloc will also stop any imports of Russian petroleum products from February 5. A G7 price cap on the petroleum products will also be set at a later date, using exactly the same mechanism as for crude oil, the Commission said.From Monday, EU shipping companies will only be allowed to carry Russian crude if it is sold below or at the G7 price cap, which will be reviewed every two months, starting from mid-January, to keep it at least 5 percent below the market price.If the price cap changes after the regular review mechanism, there will be a 90-day grace period to ensure that no vessel is caught at sea carrying oil bought at a price that is not accepted.The price cap review is an EU-specific mechanism that will require unanimity among the 27 countries that make up the bloc for any changes to the price level. Once a change is agreed by the EU, it will be then discussed at the G7 level, which includes also the United States, Canada, Britain and Japan.Before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in February 2022, more than half of Russia's oil was exported to Europe, according to the International Energy Association.Since the conflict, however, EU countries have been desperately trying to decrease their dependency.\n\nBelarusian Defense\u00a0Minister Viktor Khrenin discussed\u00a0bilateral military\u00a0cooperation with Russian Defense\u00a0Minister Sergei Shoigu in Minsk on Saturday.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense of Belarus said on Saturday that an agreement has been signed with Russia on \"joint provision of regional security in the military sphere\", according to RIA.\n\nThe Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said Russia will not accept a ceiling on oil prices, and the Kremlin is still analyzing the situation while some preparations have been made for such a decision by the EU, TASS reported on Saturday.Kremlin also said the mobilization had been completed, and there is no new information on this topic.\n\nA Russian businessman has been arrested at his home in London by police investigating criminal activity, Sky news reported on Saturday.\n\nVladimir Putin told Olaf Scholz that the West's approach on the war was \"destructive\".

However, he has signaled in recent weeks that Washington would like to bring Moscow back to the negotiating table.\n\nG7, Australia agree on $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil\n\nThe G7 nations and Australia agreed on capping the price on Russian seaborne crude oil to 60 U.S. dollars per barrel.

No details were immediately available on what further actions could be taken.The price cap, a G7 idea, aims to reduce Russia's income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude takes effect on December 5.Warsaw had resisted the proposed level as it examined an adjustment mechanism to keep the cap below the market price. It had pushed in EU negotiations for the cap to be as low as possible to squeeze revenues to Russia.Polish Ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sados on Friday told reporters Poland had backed the EU deal, which included a mechanism to keep the oil price cap at least 5 percent below the market rate.A spokesperson for the Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency and oversees EU countries' negotiations, said it had launched the written procedure for all 27 EU countries to formally greenlight the deal, following Poland's approval.Details of the deal are due to be published in the EU legal journal on Sunday.\n\nUkrainian embassies sent 'bloody packages' with animal eyes, says Kyiv\n\nThe reports of the \"bloody packages\" follow a series of letter bombs sent addresses in Spain,

capital were still suffering disruptions as a result.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautioned in an address to Ukrainians late on Sunday that Russia was preparing new aerial attacks.Russia

Russia's permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, was quoted as saying by Russia Today on Monday.Nebenzia noted last Wednesday that the buildings had been hit with \"American air defense

Ukraine claims this was a false pretext.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said it had received written guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations. /Genya Savilov/AFP\n\nRussia's defense ministry said it had received written guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations. /Genya Savilov/AFP\n\nShips had continued to move Ukrainian grain on the route despite the suspension, but there were concerns that it would have been unlikely to continue because insurance companies were not giving new contracts due to Moscow's move.Anakara, which helped broker the July grain deal with the UN, had earlier laid set out Russia's terms for the resumption of the deal, saying Moscow had wanted to secure its own exports of grain and fertilizers.\"Russia has some security demands after the recent attack on its ships,\" Cavusoglu said of the weekend attack on Russia's Black Sea Fleet, adding that it was also concerned about its own fertilizer and grain exports.President Zelenskyy said on Tuesday the world should respond firmly to any Russian attempts to disrupt Ukraine's export corridor, after a shutdown of the Black Sea passage earlier in the war exacerbated global food shortages.\"A reliable and long-term defense is needed for the grain corridor,\" Zelenskyy said in a late night address.\u00a0\"Russia must clearly be made aware that it will receive a tough response from the world to any steps to disrupt our food exports,\" he added. \"At issue here clearly are the lives of tens of millions of people.\"\n\nGermany said Wednesday it planned to put a limit on energy prices from the beginning of 2023, the cornerstone of a massive 200-billion-euro ($198-billion) package to ease inflationary pressure on households and businesses.The major energy market intervention would see the price for a percentage of gas usage capped from January 1 for businesses and March 1 at the latest for households, while the cost of electricity would be similarly reduced from January 1, according to a position paper published by the government.\n\nThe UK announced new sanctions against four Russian steel and petrochemical tycoons in relation to the conflict in Ukraine on Wednesday.\n\nShips, including those carrying grain from Ukraine and awaiting inspections, are seen anchored off the Istanbul coastline  in Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye, November 2, 2022. /CFP\n\nShips, including those carrying grain from Ukraine and awaiting inspections, are seen anchored off the Istanbul coastline  in Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye, November 2, 2022. /CFP\n\nGrain export shipments from Ukraine resumed on Wednesday as Russia said it was rejoining a deal brokered by the United Nations (UN) and T\u00fcrkiye to establish a safe Black Sea corridor.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament that \"shipments will continue from 1200 today (0900 GMT) as planned\", after a call between the Russian and Turkish defense ministers.Russia also confirmed that it was resuming its participation in the Ukraine grain deal, saying it had received \"sufficient\" guarantees from Kyiv on de-militarizing the maritime corridor.\u00a0\"Russia considers that the received guarantees are at the moment sufficient and is resuming the implementation of the agreement,\" the defense ministry said in a statement.\u00a0Moscow had pulled out at the weekend, saying it could not guarantee the safety of civilian ships crossing the Black Sea because of a drone attack on its fleet there. Ukraine has said that was a false pretext.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed Russia's return to the deal, a UN spokesperson said on Wednesday, and is continuing his engagement with all actors to push for the renewal and full implementation of the pact that could expire on November 19.The UN chief also remains committed to removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian food and fertilizer, said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.The prices of wheat, soybeans, corn and rapeseed fell sharply on global markets following the announcement, which eased concerns about the growing unaffordability of food.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier that the world should respond firmly to any Russian attempts to disrupt Ukraine's export corridor across the Black Sea, which was blocked after the conflict between Russia and Ukraine began on February 24.The blockade has exacerbated food shortages and a cost of living crisis in many countries as Ukraine is one of the world's biggest suppliers of grain and oilseeds.In a Tuesday night video address, Zelenskyy said ships were still moving out of Ukrainian ports with cargoes thanks to the work of T\u00fcrkiye and the UN.\"But a reliable and long-term defense is needed for the grain corridor,\" Zelenskyy said.The grains deal aimed to help avert famine in poorer countries by injecting more wheat, sunflower oil and fertilizer into world markets and ease a steep rise in prices.\n\nRussia will summon British ambassador in Moscow in the near future due to London's impact in Ukraine's attack on Sevastopol, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday.\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares has arrived in Kyiv to \"convey Spain's commitment and support to the people and government of Ukraine\", according to his social media.\n\nUp to 40% of Ukraine's energy system destroyed by Russia: Zelenskyy\n\nUp to 40% of Ukraine's energy system has been destroyed by Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday.In a meeting with European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine had to stop exporting electricity to European countries \"due to Russian missile and drone attacks which destroyed 30-40% of its energy system.\"Simson said she assured the Ukrainian president that the EU would reach out to partners \"to help with the dedicated support needed.\"\n\nOn October 18, Zelenskyy claimed that 30 percent of Ukraine's power stations had been destroyed since October 10 by Russian strikes, causing massive blackouts across the country.\n\nThere was no plan to move vessels under the Black Sea Grain Initiative on Wednesday, UN officials said in a statement on Tuesday.\u00a0Russia announced last week that it was suspending its participation in the grain deal after accusing Ukraine of using the humanitarian grain corridor to launch strikes against its Black Sea fleet and the naval base Sevastopol. However, grain shipments in and out of Ukrainian ports continued over the past days despite the Russian announcement, and Wednesday's pause is the first one since the initiative came into effect in August.\n\nLate on Tuesday, Ukraine's Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov tweeted that the Black Sea Grain Initiative will resume on Thursday when eight vessels loaded with agricultural products are expected to pass through the grain corridor, adding that Ukraine has got confirmation from the UN.According to UN data released on Tuesday, the total tonnage of grains and foodstuffs moved from Ukrainian ports under the Black Sea Grain Initiative is 9,729,083 metric tons.The UN also said that its Coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative Amir Abdulla continues his discussions with all three member state parties \u2013 Russia, Ukraine and T\u00fcrkiye \u2013 to resume full participation at the Joint Coordination Center following Russia's suspension of the participation.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held phone talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Black Sea grain export deal, T\u00fcrkiye's presidency said on Tuesday.Erdogan told Putin that he is sure solution-oriented cooperation can be established, and Ankara is making efforts with all sides to solve problems regarding the implementation of the deal, which was brokered by T\u00fcrkiye and the United Nations in July.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday he had an \"important and productive\" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron on Ukraine's defense and initiatives to restore its destroyed energy infrastructure.Macron said France would help Ukraine repair water and energy infrastructure damaged by Russian strikes, and his country will also help boost Ukraine's anti-air defenses.The two presidents had agreed to hold an international conference in Paris on December 13 to support Ukrainian civilians in winter.\n\nConsidering 'further steps' over allegation Britain attacked Nord Stream: Kremlin\n\nThe Kremlin said on Tuesday it was considering what \"further steps\" to take in response to its allegation that Britain was responsible for an attack on the Nord Stream undersea gas pipelines.Russia's defence ministry stated on Saturday that British navy personnel had blown up the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September, an assertion that London said was false and designed to distract from Russian military failures in Ukraine.The Kremlin also mentioned no decision had been taken on whether to repair the Russian-owned pipelines.\n\n3 more ships leave Ukrainian ports under grain deal despite Russian suspension\n\nThree outbound vessels left Ukrainian ports by midday on Tuesday under the Black Sea grain export deal, the United Nations-led coordination center said, the second day of sailings after Russia suspended participation in the initiative.\n\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar has told Ukrainian defense and infrastructure ministers that keeping the Black Sea grain export deal going is important and that, as a humanitarian initiative, it should be segregated from the conflict. \u00a0Akar's comments were published in a ministry statement on Tuesday, a day after he told his Russian counterpart that Moscow should re-evaluate its decision to suspend its participation in the deal, which was brokered in July by the UN and T\u00fcrkiye in order to keep agricultural commodities flowing to global markets. \u00a0On October 29, Russia said it was suspending its participation in the grain deal after accusing Ukraine of using the humanitarian grain corridor to launch strikes against its Black Sea fleet and the naval base Sevastopol.On Monday, both Russian Defense Ministry and President Vladimir Putin said Russia is suspending - but not ending - its participation in the deal.\n\nPutin: Gazprom has right to examine Nord Stream explosion sites\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told a press briefing on Monday that Russian gas giant Gazprom has the right to examine the Nord Stream explosion sites, after CEO Alexei Miller had briefed him earlier in the day about the company's inspection, which found two 3.5-meter craters.\"So this is an obvious terrorist attack. And it's hard for us to control it. Because it's still in the special economic zones of Denmark and Sweden, then further Germany,\" Putin said.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog, revealed on Monday that it has begun an \"independent verification\" in Ukraine of Russia's recent allegations that Kyiv is producing and preparing to deploy so-called \"dirty bombs\" and nuclear blackmail. Russia also called on the West to influence Ukraine to abandon such plans.In response, Ukraine has refuted the allegations and accused Russia of setting the stage for deploying its own radioactive \"dirty bomb\" device on Ukrainian soil by making such claims.In a statement, the IAEA confirmed that it has \"begun and will soon complete verification activities at two locations in Ukraine\" following a request from the Ukrainian government.

It also accused Ukraine of firing near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, but said the radiation situation remained normal, TASS reported.\u00b7 Ukraine's east military command said there were fierce battles near Bakhmut in Donetsk region, and Ukrainian forces had held back Russian assaults on two other areas in the region, around Avdiivka and Uhledar.\u00b7 Russian strikes left 80 percent of consumers in Kyiv without water and 350,000 homes without electricity, the Ukrainian capital's mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram.\u00b7 T\u00fcrkiye is \"determined\" to continue efforts to keep the Ukraine grain deal in force despite Russia suspending its participation, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. \"Although Russia acts hesitantly... we will resolutely continue our efforts to serve humanity,\" Erdogan said in a televised address.\u00a0\u00b7 Two cargo ships loaded with grain and other agricultural products left Ukrainian ports, according to a marine traffic website. The ships, Admiral de Ribas and Mount Baker, left port days after Russia suspended its participation in an agreement that allowed vital grain shipments to pass through the Black Sea. A record volume of 354,500 tonnes of agricultural products left Ukrainian ports as part of the Black Sea grain deal, a spokesperson for Odesa's military administration said.\u00b7 UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed \"deep concern\" as Ukraine's maritime grain exports were halted after Russia suspended its participation in a deal that allowed the vital shipments. \"The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the ongoing situation regarding the Black Sea grain initiative,\" his spokesman said.\u00b7 Inspections of vessels carrying grain under the deal to allow the departure of foodstuffs from Ukraine ports will continue in Istanbul, the Turkish defense ministry said after Russia suspended its participation. \"There are plans to continue the inspection of grain-laden vessels waiting in Istanbul today and tomorrow,\" the ministry said in a statement.\u00b7 Russia said it recovered debris from drones that attacked its fleet in Sevastopol, exploiting the \"safe zone\" of a grain corridor, and could have been launched from a civilian ship. \"The marine drones were moving in the safe zone of the 'grain corridor',\" Russia's defense ministry said, adding it had \"lifted\" some of the drones' debris from the sea.\n\nCommercial vessels including vessels which are part of the Black Sea grain deal wait to pass the Bosphorus strait off the shores of Yenikapi, in Istanbul, Turkey. /Umit Bektas/Reuters\n\nCommercial vessels including vessels which are part of the Black Sea grain deal wait to pass the Bosphorus strait off the shores of Yenikapi, in Istanbul, Turkey. /Umit Bektas/Reuters\n\nRussia's blockade of grain exports makes it \"impossible\" for fully loaded ships to leave port, Ukraine said after Moscow claimed drone attacks on its Crimea fleet had exploited the grain corridor safe zone.Kyiv's maritime grain exports were halted after Russia pulled out of a landmark agreement that allowed the vital shipments.The July deal to unlock grain exports signed between warring nations Russia and Ukraine \u2013 and brokered by T\u00fcrkiye and the United Nations \u2013 is critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict.\"(A) bulk carrier loaded with 40 tonnes of grain was supposed to leave the Ukraine port today,\" Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov tweeted.\"These foodstuffs were intended for Ethiopians, that are on the verge of famine. But due to the blockage of the 'grain corridor' by Russia the export is impossible,\" the Ukrainian minister said.The agreement, which established a safety corridor through which vessels could travel to Istanbul for inspections, had already allowed more than nine million tonnes of Ukrainian grain to be exported and was due to be renewed on November 19.Russia announced on Saturday it would pull out of the deal after accusing Kyiv of a \"massive\" drone attack on its Black Sea fleet, which Ukraine labeled a \"false pretext.\"U.S. President Joe Biden called the move \"purely outrageous\" while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Moscow was \"weaponizing food.\"Russia's defense ministry alleged Sunday the attack drones had \"Canadian-made navigation modules,\" and that they \"were moving in the safe zone of the 'grain corridor'.\"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed \"deep concern\" about the situation, his spokesman said, and delayed his departure for an Arab League Summit in Algiers by a day \"to focus on the issue.\"The EU urged Russia to \"revert its decision.\"\n\nGerman gas price cap for large firms to apply from Jan. 1\n\nThe German government has agreed in principle to apply a cap on gas prices for some 25,000 large industrial companies from January 1, 2023, the economy ministry said on Monday, after an expert commission presented its proposals in Berlin.The ministry said the government will make some technical adjustments to the commission's original proposal, but a cap of 7 eurocents per kilowatt hours for 70 percent of companies consumption will apply per the commission's suggestions.\n\nTwelve ships carrying grain left Ukrainian ports on Monday despite Russia having abandoned a UN-backed deal to guarantee exports from Ukraine.The resumption of food exports from Ukrainian ports suggested a much-feared scenario had been averted for now. International officials had feared that Moscow would reimpose a blockade on Ukrainian grain, after Russia announced on Saturday that it was withdrawing from the UN-backed program that escorts cargo ships through the Black Sea.\"Civilian cargo ships can never be a military target or held hostage. The food must flow,\" tweeted Amir Abdullah, the UN official who coordinates the program.Shortly after, Ukraine confirmed that 12 ships had set sail. The 354,500 tonnes of grain they carried was far more than typically leave in a single day, suggesting a backlog was being cleared after exports were interrupted on Sunday.Ukraine and Russia are both among the world's largest exporters of food. For three months, the UN-backed deal has guaranteed Ukrainian exports can reach markets, preventing what international officials had said could have been global famine.The news that Moscow was pulling out of the deal had sent global wheat prices soaring by more than 5 percent on Monday morning.Moscow said it was forced to pull out of the shipping deal after blaming Kyiv for explosions that damaged Russian navy ships in a Crimean port on Saturday.Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied it was behind those blasts but says Russia's navy is a legitimate military target. Moscow said the blasts were caused by a fleet of sea and air drones.The ships that sailed on Monday included one hired by the UN World Food Program to bring 40,000 tonnes of grain to drought-hit Africa.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry on Monday summoned the Dutch ambassador to protest at what it said was an attempt by British intelligence to recruit the Russian military attache at the Russian embassy in The Hague.In a statement, the Foreign Ministry called on the Dutch authorities to prevent \"countries that the Netherlands calls its allies\" from taking such \"unfriendly\" actions.\n\nNorway's military will sharpen the country's security from November 1 in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Monday.\n\nThe Czech Republic on Monday renewed its support and continued military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, according to the government office of the republic on social media.Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala arrived in Kyiv and talked with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.\n\nTurkish and UN teams restarted vessel inspections under black sea grain deal after Russian withdrawal, a UN spokesperson said on Monday.\n\nPower out in Kyiv after Russia strikes: mayor\n\nRussian strikes early Monday knocked out electricity and water in parts of Kyiv, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said.\"An area of Kyiv is without electricity and certain areas without water following Russian strikes,\" Vitali Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging service.The Russian side has not responded to the claim.\n\nThe UN Coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Amir Abdulla, tweeted on Monday that civilian cargo ships can never be held hostage or targeted militarily, and that \"the food must flow\" under the deal from which Russia withdrew on the weekend.Abdulla's comments came after the United Nations, T\u00fcrkiye and Ukraine pressed ahead with the transit plan despite Russia claiming that it could not \"guarantee the safety of civilian ships\" following an attack on its Black Sea fleet.\n\nA series of explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Monday morning, Reuters said, while regional authorities in northern, eastern and central Ukraine also reported missile strikes.\n\nA day after Russia suspended its participation in the Black Sea grain initiative that allowed food exports from Ukrainian ports, the United Nations, T\u00fcrkiye and Ukraine agreed on Sunday on a plan to move 16 vessels that are in Turkish waters on October 31.The Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul said in a statement that the three delegations had also agreed for inspections to be conducted on 40 outbound vessels on Monday.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday expressed \"deep concern\" as Ukraine's maritime grain exports were halted after Russia suspended its participation in a deal that allowed the vital shipments.\"The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the ongoing situation regarding the Black Sea Grain Initiative,\" his spokesperson said.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense on Sunday said it had recovered fragments of sea drones used in the attack against ships of the Black Sea Fleet and civilian ships in the waters near the city of Sevastopol.The wreckage of marine unmanned vehicles, used by Kyiv under the leadership of\u00a0British\u00a0representatives, was discovered and raised to the surface, the defense ministry said, adding that Canadian-made navigation modules were installed on the drones.Ukraine launched drones from the coast near Odesa, then changed direction from the \"grain corridor\" security zone to Sevastopol, according to the ministry.The ministry said Ukraine attacked the Black Sea Fleet near Sevastopol with 16 drones early on Saturday, and that British navy \"specialists\" had helped coordinate what it called a terrorist attack, a claim Britain has denied.Ukrainian officials have suggested that Russia itself may have been responsible for the explosions, which it has used as a pretext to pull out of a UN-brokered grain deal, a move that undermines efforts to ease a global food crisis.\n\nPower outage in Energodar after Ukrainian strikes on energy infrastructure\n\nPower was cut off in Energodar after Ukrainian troops struck the city's energy infrastructure, Russia's RIA reported, citing the head of administration.\n\nThe European Union on Sunday urged Russia to reverse its decision to suspend participation in a vital Ukraine grain export deal.\u00a0\"Russia's decision to suspend participation in the Black Sea deal puts at risk the main export route of much-needed grain and fertilizers to address the global food crisis caused by its war against Ukraine,\" the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted. \"The EU urges Russia to revert its decision.\"\u00a0Russia said it would not participate in the deal after Ukraine attacked its Black Sea Fleet and civilian ships in Sevastopol port on Saturday. It said the attacked Black Sea Fleet ships were involved in ensuring the security of the grain corridor used to export agricultural goods from Ukrainian ports.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday said the Russian decision was \"predictable\" and accused Russia of deliberately delaying the functioning of the corridor and seeking to undermine the deal since September.\u00a0Russia's decision also drew criticism from some Western countries, including the U.S., with President Joe Biden denouncing it as \"purely outrageous,\" saying it would increase starvation.Russia's ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, on Sunday scolded the U.S. for its remark and blasted it for not showing any sign of condemnation toward Kyiv's Sevastopol port attack.However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian leadership, including President Vladimir Putin, remains ready to negotiate on Ukraine and talk with the West, only if there are\u00a0realistic proposals\u00a0based on\u00a0equal\u00a0approaches, according to an interview with local broadcaster Channel One Russia aired on Sunday.\n\nThe Russian government has added 11 British overseas territories to its list of unfriendly countries and territories, RIA reported on Sunday.\n\nShips, including those carrying grain from Ukraine and awaiting inspections, are seen anchored off the Istanbul coastline, T\u00fcrkiye, October 14, 2022. /CFP\n\nShips, including those carrying grain from Ukraine and awaiting inspections, are seen anchored off the Istanbul coastline, T\u00fcrkiye, October 14, 2022. /CFP\n\nRussia on Saturday suspended participation in the UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal after what it said was a major Ukrainian drone attack on its fleet and civilian ships at the Sevastopol base.Russia's Defense Ministry said Ukraine attacked the Black Sea Fleet near Sevastopol with 16 drones early on Saturday, and claimed British navy \"specialists\" had helped coordinate the \"terrorist\" attack.Britain on Saturday said Russia's claims were false. Ukraine neither confirmed nor denied carrying out the attack, but described Russia's decision to halt the grain deal as \"primitive blackmail.\"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's \"nonsensical\" move required a strong international response from the UN and the Group of 20 (G20) major economies.\"This is a completely transparent attempt by Russia to return to the threat of large-scale famine for Africa, for Asia,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address, adding that Russia should be kicked out of the G20.U.S. President Joe Biden denounced the move as \"purely outrageous\" and said it would increase starvation.\u00a0The Russian side told UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a letter, according to Reuters, that it was suspending the deal for an \"indefinite term\" because it could not \"guarantee safety of civilian ships\" travelling under the pact. Russia has also asked the UN Security Council to meet on Monday over the attack, Russia's Deputy UN Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy wrote on Twitter.Russia said it had repelled the attack but that the ships targeted were involved in ensuring the grain corridor out of Ukraine's Black Sea ports.Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow was using a false pretext to sink the deal. In a statement, the European Union said \"all parties must refrain from any unilateral action that would imperil\" a deal it described as a critical humanitarian effort.Since Russia and Ukraine signed the UN-backed Black Sea Grain Initiative in T\u00fcrkiye on July 22, more than 9 million tonnes of corn, wheat, sunflower products, barley, rapeseed and soya have been exported.But Russia has repeatedly alleged that rich Western countries were taking the grain exported from Ukraine, instead of allowing it to be delivered to the world's poorest countries as originally intended.The United Nations is in contact with Russian authorities about the situation, a UN spokesman said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held phone talks on Saturday with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and discussed \"regional and global issues,\" including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the State Department said.Jaishankar will visit Russia on November 8, the Russian embassy in India said on Thursday.\n\nRussia suspended participation in the grain deal to export agricultural produce from Ukraine after ships were attacked in Sevastopol, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Saturday.\n\nRussia says to raise Nord Stream, Crimea attack at UN Security Council\n\nRussia said on Saturday that it would raise the Nord Stream pipeline blasts and an attack in Crimea, both incidents in which Moscow has alleged British involvement, at the UN Security Council.\"The Russian side intends to draw the attention of the international community, in particular through the UN Security Council, to the series of terrorist attacks against Russia in the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, including the involvement of Great Britain,\" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram.\n\nRussia ready to supply 500,000 tonnes of grain to poorest countries\n\nRussia is ready to supply up to 500,000 tonnes of grain to poorest countries in next four months, TASS news agency reported on Saturday citing a Russian official.\n\nRussia and Ukraine on Saturday confirmed new prisoner swap has been completed, with 50 servicemen from each side returned to their countries.\u00a0Two Ukrainian civilians were also in the swap, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff Andriy Yermak\u00a0said.Russia has not said whether there are civilians among the prisoner swap.\n\nAerial view of the Nord Stream gas leak seen from a Danish defense aircraft at mid-sea in Denmark, September 30, 2022. /CFP\n\nAerial view of the Nord Stream gas leak seen from a Danish defense aircraft at mid-sea in Denmark, September 30, 2022. /CFP\n\nBritain on Saturday denied Russian claims that British navy personnel blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month, calling them \"false claims of an epic scale\".\"To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defense is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale,\" a spokesperson for Britain's ministry of defense said.Earlier on Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that representatives of a UK Navy unit blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines and accused the UK of being \"involved\" in the attack on Russia's Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol port. \u00a0\u00a0\"Representatives of this unit of the British Navy took part in the planning, provision and implementation of a terrorist attack in the Baltic Sea on September 26 that blew up the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines,\" Russia's defense ministry said in a statement. \u00a0\u00a0Russia claimed on Saturday that Ukraine launched a drone attack on Sevastopol port \u2013 home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet, which Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razgozhaye called the \"most massive\" drone attack on the Crimean peninsula since February.

Kyiv's soldiers north of the city have reported a drop-off in Russian shellfire, a sign they claim that Moscow's forces are suffering manpower, supply and hardware shortages.\u00b7 Critical infrastructure across Ukraine came under aerial bombardment again on Saturday, with several regions reporting strikes on energy facilities. Russian air attacks have hit at least half of Ukraine's thermal generation capacity, causing billions of dollars of damage since October 10, Ukraine's energy minister said.\u00b7 Kyiv said there have been no signs of progress towards an agreement involving Russia, Ukraine and the UN nuclear watchdog on defusing the situation at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.\u00b7 Britain, France and Germany have called for a UN probe into Kyiv's accusations that Russia is using Iranian-origin drones to attack Ukraine, in what they said was a violation of a UN Security Council Resolution. Tehran denies supplying the drones to Moscow and Russia has denied its forces used Iranian drones to attack Ukraine.\u00b7 A Ukrainian air force spokesperson said Kyiv was taking down 85 percent of what it says are Iranian-made \"kamikaze\" drones fired by Russia, but it still needed it allies' support to block Tehran from selling Moscow ballistic missiles.\u00b7 U.S. Defense Secretary Austin and Russian Defence Minister Shoigu spoke for the first time since May; a call that Moscow said was aimed at eliminating misunderstandings.

Destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster,\" he said.Russia has in turn accused Kyiv of firing rockets on the dam and planning to destroy the infrastructure. Ukrainian officials said such a statement was a sign that Moscow might blow it up and blame Kyiv.\u00a0UK PM resigns: Why, and what happens nextNeither of the warring parties have shown any evidence to support their allegations, but if the event were to take place, it would drastically change the landscape of the conflict in Ukraine's south.The vast Dnipro cuts through southern Ukraine and is several kilometres wide in places. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding cities and town below it, towards Kherson, which Ukrainian forces are preparing to recapture in a major advance.It would also severely damage the canal system that irrigates large swathes of southern Ukraine, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and integrated into its own territory in 2014.Zelenskyy called on world leaders to make clear that blowing up the dam would be treated \"exactly the same as the use of weapons of mass destruction,\" with similar consequences to those threatened if Russia uses nuclear or chemical weapons.Concern over the dam has echoes of a World War Two disaster at another dam further upriver, which Ukrainian historians said was dynamited by the Soviets as their troops retreated, causing floods that swept away villages and killed thousands of people.Zelenskyy's warning comes as just down stream from the dam one of the most important battles of the eight-month-old war is coming to a head. Ukrainian forces are advancing along the river's west bank, hoping to recapture the strategic city of Kherson and surround thousands of Russian troops.Ukraine is refusing to release any information from the Kherson front, but Russian commander General Sergei Surovikin said this week the situation in the area was \"already difficult\" and Russia was \"not ruling out difficult decisions\" there.\n\nRussia says 2 killed in shelling from Ukrainian forces in Shebekino\n\nTwo civilians were killed in shelling from the Ukrainian armed forces in Russia's Shebekino City, Belgorod region, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Saturday.Almost 15,000 people were disconnected from electricity as a result of the shelling, Gladkov said on the Telegram app.Kyiv has not responded to this accusation.\n\nRussia says it repels Ukraine's 'offensives' in three regions\n\nRussia has repelled Ukrainian \"offensives\" in Luhansk, Donetsk and Kherson regions, the Interfax news agency reported on Friday.Meanwhile, a Russian air strike hit a plant in the Kharkiv region that is believed to be making parts for Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, Interfax reported, citing the Ukrainian defense ministry.\n\nA lady looks out the window while holding a candle for light inside her house during a power outage, Borodyanka, Ukraine, October 20, 2022. /CFP\n\nA lady looks out the window while holding a candle for light inside her house during a power outage, Borodyanka, Ukraine, October 20, 2022. /CFP\n\nCritical infrastructure across Ukraine was pounded by more than a dozen Russian missiles on Saturday, the Ukrainian air force said, with several regions reporting strikes on energy facilities and power outages.Ukraine's air force command reported that 33 missiles had been fired at Ukraine on Saturday morning, and that 18 of those had been shot down.Russian air attacks have hit at least half of Ukraine's thermal generation capacity, causing billions of dollars of damage since October 10, though not all those power units have stopped working completely, Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Friday.Halushchenko told Reuters in an interview that Ukraine may need electricity imports to get through the winter after attacks that had struck 30-40 percent of power infrastructure and traders were already holding negotiations with suppliers.Shortly after daybreak on Saturday, local officials in regions across Ukraine began reporting strikes on energy facilities and power outages as engineers scrambled to restore the ruined network.

It would be a more sensible and viable project,\" Demirtas said.The project will convince European countries, which want to reduce their dependency on Moscow, to buy gas from the new gas hub, the analyst noted.The European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Russia, has vowed to cut purchases of Russian gas by at least two-thirds by the end of the year amid skyrocketing energy prices.The Russian leader is trying to reassure European nations scrambling to curb energy use this winter that they can still count on Russia for gas needs, Demirtas added.\n\nA view of the construction site of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant being built by Rosatom, in the province of Mersin, T\u00fcrkiye, March 10, 2021. /CFP\n\nA view of the construction site of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant being built by Rosatom, in the province of Mersin, T\u00fcrkiye, March 10, 2021. /CFP\n\nMultibillion-dollar projects such as the TurkStream pipeline and the nuclear power plant being built by Russia in southern T\u00fcrkiye symbolize the rapprochement between Moscow and Ankara since 2016.\"T\u00fcrkiye is now becoming a new reliable energy corridor for the world and Europe,\" said Altug Karatas, an energy expert at the Independent Industrialists and Businessmen Association.\"T\u00fcrkiye is the only route through which Azerbaijani gas, even Turkmen gas, Iranian gas, and Eastern Mediterranean gas will pass\" and flow to Europe, the expert was quoted by internet daily haber7com as saying.Once it grows into a hub as planned, T\u00fcrkiye will become an energy exchange in the world's natural gas market and turn into a center where gas prices are determined, Karatas noted.Following the blasts at the two Nord Stream pipelines, TurkStream, a natural gas pipeline running from Russia to T\u00fcrkiye, along with limited transit flow via Ukraine, is almost the last remaining route as Russia has cut gas shipments to Europe.As a NATO member, T\u00fcrkiye has close relations with both Ukraine and Russia and has not joined the Western sanctions drive on Moscow. Instead, it has been seeking to mediate between the two countries since their conflict broke out in February.Still, there are some aspects of the Russian proposal that need to be clarified through negotiations, a source close to the Turkish government told Xinhua.Commercial and legal points have to be agreed upon between T\u00fcrkiye and Russia, and eventually third parties will likely export Russian gas to European markets, the source said on condition of anonymity.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Friday that the Russian proposal needs \"to be studied well.\"\"There are investments that need to be made.

Cuts in Russian \u200bnatural gas supplies have seen prices rise by 150 \u200bpercent \u200bor more across Europe, and as the impasse over a solution \u200bhas dragged on, cracks in the union \u200bare beginning to show.For months EU countries have presented a plethora of solutions that range from bloc-wide price caps, joint purchases on the international market and decoupling of the price of gas and electricity.\"First, we will incentivize the demand reduction; then we will ensure solidarity among member states,\" said Kadri Simson, EU Energy Commissioner. \"We will also intervene, and we will facilitate the joint purchase of gas, and all these four streams will reinforce each other and help us to limit prices and ensure the security of supply.\"Ahead of the talks, most EU countries agreed on a gas cap, but there was disagreement on how it should be applied. Some member states favored decoupling the price of gas from electricity to bring down prices, as Spain and Portugal have done.\u00a0Germany and the Netherlands have proposed using the economic power of the bloc to buy gas jointly from non-Russian suppliers. EU countries agree on the bloc's energy diagnosis. The problem is finding the right therapy.Despite the challenges, EU commissioners have charted a way forward - they favor buying gas jointly on the international market.\"We are putting forward a proposal to facilitate the joint purchase of gas this will allow the EU to use our collective purchase power to limit prices and avoid member states to outbid each other on the market,\" said the energy commissioner.\u00a0Energy experts say the time for waiting is over. Europe's energy crunch, they fear, will be severe this winter without a long-term fix.\"I believe the most promising thing would be the decoupling of the price of gas and electricity,\" said Petr Holub, a spokesman for Greenpeace. \"We suggested that as one of the solutions a few weeks ago, and we think it will bring immediate relief because the prices will go down.\"Before the meeting, the bloc had already taken measures to cushion citizens from the unprecedented energy crunch.

international donors to increase financial support, saying more money was needed to rebuild schools and homes.He told finance ministers at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings that Ukraine needed about $55 billion \u2013 $38 billion to cover next year's estimated budget deficit, and another $17 billion to start to rebuild critical infrastructure, including schools, housing and energy facilities.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank President David Malpass and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded by underscoring the determination of the global community to continue to support Ukraine.Yellen said the U.S. would begin to disburse another $4.5 billion in grant assistance to Ukraine in coming weeks.Georgieva said the IMF planned to work with the Ukrainian authorities to set up a new \"Ukraine Economic Forum\" suggested by Zelenskyy\u00a0to share information, calibrate financing needs and coordinate macroeconomic developments and policies.And the IMF would also start talks soon with Ukraine about a new IMF monitoring instrument known as Program Monitoring with Board Involvement (PMB) and a comprehensive macroeconomic framework

October 11, 2022. /Reuters\n\nThe question of how, when and whether to cap gas prices is set to dominate another meeting of European Union (EU) countries on Wednesday, as they pursue a joint plan to target high gas prices - a compromise that has eluded them for weeks.The 27-country EU is plotting its next move to tame soaring energy prices and shield consumers from surging bills, as Europe heads into a winter of scarce Russian gas, a cost-of-living crisis and the looming threat of recession.\"We need to find a quick solution that will be applicable to all the European Union,\" a senior EU official said. \"National solutions are not a way forward.\"EU energy ministers meet in Prague on Wednesday to attempt to provide clearer instructions on what the European Commission should propose as the bloc's next emergency energy measure.But countries still cannot decide what they want.With gas prices almost 90 percent higher than a year ago, most EU countries say they want a gas price cap but disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, remain opposed.Talks among EU leaders last week did little to clarify the next steps. Those discussions \"went in all directions\", one EU diplomat said - referring to the numerous options being floated, including a price cap on all gas, pipeline gas, or just gas used to produce electricity.With so much at stake, seasonal weather forecasts have become unusually important, with traders and policy makers eyeing reports from the EU-funded European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts in particular.Their Copernicus Climate Change Service produces rolling three-month forecasts that assess the probability of different weather patterns over the continent, using a supercomputer that crunches data from national forecasters.\"The last few weeks have been really busy for us,\" Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus Climate Change Service, told AFP ahead of the publication on Thursday of their next forecast for the November-January period.\"This year, there is clearly a geopolitical interest in the question,\" he added.Although it is still too early to make confident predictions about the winter, initial indications are that it will be warm overall, but with a risk of early cold snaps in November and December.Could Algeria be the savior?The Algeria-EU Energy Business Forum kicked off on Tuesday in Algiers to provide more energy cooperation opportunities between the two sides.\"Algeria is the largest natural gas producer in Africa, and the third largest supplier of fossil fuel to EU, while EU, in turn, is the most important market for Algerian gas,\" said Algerian Prime Minister Ayman Benabderrahmane, stressing that \"both sides aim to strengthening energy security and promoting renewable energies and energy efficiency.\"\"Algeria has large potential in terms of oil and gas reserves,\" he added, noting \"the intensification of exploration efforts is at the core of Algerian strategy, and investment opportunities are open to European partners.\"European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson said that Europe is seeking new gas suppliers following the end of cooperation with Russia, stressing \"a big shift in the EU's gas support.\"More U.S. import, at higher pricesThe U.S. exported more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe than other parts of the world, according to preliminary tanker tracking data.Almost 70 percent of the U.S. LNG cargoes in September headed to Europe, up from 56 percent and 63 percent respectively in the previous two months.U.S. spot natural gas prices at the Henry Hub rose in September to $7.88 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the highest since 2008, as soaring global prices kept demand for U.S. LNG strong.\n\nA view shows a fire on the Kerch bridge at sunrise in the Kerch Strait, Crimea, on October 8, 2022. /Stringer/Reuters\n\nA view shows a fire on the Kerch bridge at sunrise in the Kerch Strait, Crimea, on October 8, 2022. /Stringer/Reuters\n\nRussia has detained eight suspects over the deadly explosion of the bridge linking Crimea to Russia, the FSB security service said in a statement quoted by news agencies.The suspects include five Russians and \"three Ukrainian and Armenian citizens,\" it said, without providing more details.\"The explosives were hidden in 22 plastic film rolls weighing 22,770 kilograms,\" it said.What is the European Political Community?The rolls were left on a boat in August from the Ukrainian port of Odesa to Bulgaria. They then transited through the port of Poti in Georgia, and were then sent overland to Armenia before arriving by road in Russia, according to the FSB.The explosives entered Russia on October 4 in a truck with Georgian license plates and reached the region of Krasnodar on October 6, two days before the blasts, the FSB said.The \"terrorist attack\" was organized by Ukrainian secret services, with a Kyiv agent having coordinated the transit of the explosives, according to the FSB.On Saturday, a blast ripped through the road and rail bridge connecting Crimea to Russia, killing three people, causing damage and igniting a massive fire.The bridge is logistically crucial for Moscow \u2013 a vital transport link for moving military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. It is also hugely symbolic, with President Vladimir Putin having personally inaugurated the structure in 2018.Russia blamed the explosion on Kyiv on Sunday and launched missile attacks across Ukraine, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 100, the very next day.On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia's response to any further Ukrainian attacks would be \"severe.\"\n\nFirefighters were called in to work on the Druzhba pipeline leak. /Kacper Pempel/Reuters\n\nFirefighters were called in to work on the Druzhba pipeline leak. /Kacper Pempel/Reuters\n\nA leak on a pipeline carrying oil from Russia to Europe has stoked concerns about energy security, while European Union ministers work on proposals to address the fuel crisis facing the continent heading into winter.Poland revealed they had detected the leak in one of the Druzhba pipelines on the main route for oil to Germany, but believe it was probably caused by an accident.The Nord Stream gas pipeline that serves Germany is currently out of action after a leak last month that has been blamed on sabotage by Russia and the West.The discovery of the leak in Poland, which operator PERN said it found on Tuesday evening, comes as Europe faces a severe energy crisis in the aftermath of the conflict in Ukraine which has cut supplies of gas in a continuing stand-off.\"Here we can talk about accidental damage,\"\u00a0said Mateusz Berger, Poland's top official in charge of energy infrastructure. He added there were no grounds to believe the leak was caused by sabotage.\n\nWhat is the European Political Community?\n\nPERN said in a statement that at this point the exact causes of the leak were unknown. It was detected in a section of the pipe around 70 kilometers from the central Polish city of Plock.A German economy ministry spokesperson insisted their oil supply was secure and the Schwedt and Leuna refineries were still receiving oil via the Druzhba pipeline Freundschaft 1 via\u00a0Poland.The spokesperson admitted the ministry was watching the situation closely and both refineries had been increasing their on-site stocks in recent weeks as a precautionary measure.The Druzhba oil pipeline, whose name means \"friendship\" in Russian, is one of the world's largest, supplying Russian oil to much of central Europe including Germany,\u00a0Poland, Belarus, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czechia and Austria.\"The main action (we are taking) is to pump out the liquid and locate the leak and stop it,\" a fire brigade spokesman told Polish TV. \"When the pressure decreases, the leak will stop and allow us to reach the leak.\"\n\nPERN said the second line of the pipeline, and other elements of PERN's infrastructure, were working as normal.Russian oil imports into the EU and the UK fell 35 percent to 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in August from 2.6 million bpd in January. However, the EU was still the biggest market for Russian crude, according to the International Energy Agency.The UK has already stopped importing Russian crude, with the EU banning imports from December in an attempt to strip the Kremlin of revenue to fund the conflict.The ban will most likely create a shortage of oil due to a general lack of spare crude volumes in the world.\n\nThe European Commission has recommended granting EU candidate status to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the bloc's Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nUkraine conflict \u2013 day 231: NATO warns Russian nuclear strike would change the course of conflict\n\nSoldiers of Ukraine's 5th Regiment of Assault Infantry stand next to their bunker at a front line near Toretsk in the Donetsk region. /Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP\n\nSoldiers of Ukraine's 5th Regiment of Assault Infantry stand next to their bunker at a front line near Toretsk in the Donetsk region. /Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP\n\n\u00b7 Ukraine's allies announced the delivery of new air defenses and recommitted to providing it robust, enduring military assistance at a meeting at NATO headquarters on Wednesday, saying Russian missile strikes two days ago only further united them.\u00a0\u00b7 A Russian nuclear strike would change the course of the conflict and almost certainly trigger a \"physical response\" from Ukraine allies and potentially from NATO, a senior NATO official said.

He said there were no grounds to believe the leak was caused by sabotage.PERN said in a statement that at this point the exact causes of the leak were unknown. It was detected in a section of the pipe around 70 kilometres from the central Polish city of Plock.The Druzhba oil pipeline, whose name means \"friendship\" in Russian, is one of the world's largest, supplying Russian oil to much of central Europe including Germany, Poland, Belarus, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Austria.\"The main action (we are taking) is to pump out the liquid and locate the leak and stop it,\" fire brigade spokesman Karol Kierzkowski told Polish state broadcaster TVP Info.\"When the pressure decreases, the leak will stop and allow us to reach the leak,\" he said, adding that it was too early to establish the cause. He said there was no danger to local residents.The second line of the pipeline, and other elements of PERN's infrastructure, were working as normal, PERN said.\"At this point, all PERN services (technical, operational, in-house fire brigade and environmental protection) are taking action in accordance with the algorithms provided for this type of situation,\" the operator said.A spokesperson for the Czech pipeline operator MERO said it had not seen any change in flows to the Czech Republic.Germany's Schwedt refinery, which supplies 90 percent of Berlin's fuel, its economy ministry and federal network regulator were not immediately available for comment.The German government aims to eliminate imports of oil from Russia by the end of the year under European Union sanctions. But in the first seven months of the year, Russia was still its top supplier, accounting for just over 30 percent of oil imports.The Schwedt refinery has been particularly dependent on Druzhba.The German government has been in talks to secure oil from Kazakhstan to supply Schwedt, but even that oil would have to flow to Germany via the Druzhba pipeline.The leak in the subsea Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines has been blamed on sabotage by both the West and Russia. It was not immediately clear how significant the leak in the Druzhba pipeline was.\n\nMore weapons arrive in Ukraine from Germany, U.S.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said via Twitter on Tuesday that IRIS-T air defense systems and four High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) have arrived in Ukraine from Germany and the U.S., respectively.The Group of Seven (G7) nations committed on Tuesday to supporting Ukraine indefinitely, adding in a statement after a leaders' call that \"any use by Russia of nuclear weapons would be met with severe consequences.\"\"We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" the statement read.\n\nUkrainian forces have \"liberated\" five settlements in the Kherson region, news agency Ukrinform reported on Wednesday, citing Operational Command South.Russia has not yet responded to the claim.\n\nExplosions were heard and air raid sirens have blared in and around the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, local media has reported.\n\nPutin: Moscow is 'open to dialogue' on Ukraine nuclear plant\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi on Tuesday that he is \"open to dialogue\" on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\nThe German IRIS-T anti-aircraft weapon has now been handed over to the Ukrainian military, German media Spiegel reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations held a virtual meeting on Tuesday to discuss their support for Ukraine, RIA has reported.\n\nThe Kremlin announced that Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin and\u00a0Turkish President\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0will meet in Astana on Thursday.Kremlin Spokesperson\u00a0Dmitry Peskov\u00a0said that Ukraine and bilateral relations will be on the agenda of the Putin-Erdogan meeting.\n\nUkraine conflict - day 230: G7 to discuss response to Russia's deadly missile attacks with Zelenskyy\n\n\u00b7 Kyiv has vowed to strengthen its armed forces after Russia launched its biggest aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities since the start of the conflict, killing 14 people and wounding more than 100 in a single day.\u00a0\u00b7 Group of Seven leaders will hold a call on Tuesday with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where he is expected to push the leaders of the world's richest nations to send weapons to defend itself from more missile attacks.\u00b7 Russian President Putin said he ordered the \"massive\" long-range strikes on Monday in response to Kyiv's purported attack on a strategic bridge linking Russia to Crimea, a key transport link for Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine's south.\u00b7 Russia's defense ministry said its missile attacks, which tore through intersections, parks and tourist sites, had hit \"all designated targets\", including Ukrainian military, communications and energy infrastructure.\u00b7 The presidents of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia condemned the strikes in a joint communique, saying they constituted \"war crimes under international law.\"\u00b7 According to the UN, the wave of attacks on Ukraine may have violated international laws on war and would \"amount to a war crime\" if civilians were deliberately targeted.\u00a0\u00b7 President Joe Biden, after speaking to his Ukrainian counterpart on the phone, said the U.S. would provide advanced air defence systems to Kyiv in the wake of the attacks.

Repairing the bridge is currently a top priority.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant lost its connection to external power supply early on Saturday due to shelling, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said, blaming Russia.Energoatom said the plant was now getting power to cover its own needs from its backup diesel generators.\"The diesel generators started automatically. The available supplies of diesel fuel for their operation in this mode will be enough for 10 days,\" the company wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Friday that shelling the day before had damaged a power line that provided electricity to reactor Unit 6 at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, forcing the unit to temporarily rely on its emergency diesel generators.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday that its executive board has approved Ukraine's request for $1.3 billion in additional emergency funding to help sustain its economy.\n\nEuropean Union leaders on Friday agreed to give more financial and military aid to Ukraine, but a full day of talks in Prague's ornate royal castle seemed to bring them no closer to deciding on whether or how to cap gas prices.Most of the EU's 27 countries want a cap on gas prices, but disagree on the details, with options including a cap on all gas, a \"dynamic corridor\", a price ceiling on gas used for power generation specifically or on Russian gas only.The EU has been discussing the matter for weeks, so far without result, although the 27 have agreed other joint steps to help them weather an acute energy crunch as runaway prices threaten to bring about a recession in the bloc.\"Everyone agrees we need to lower power prices but there is no agreement what instruments to use to that end exactly,\" Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said.Italy's Mario Draghi said the bloc's executive European Commission would present for the next meeting of EU leaders on October 20 to 21 a broader package of short-term measures to lower prices and longer-term steps to redesign the electricity market.The cap is one of a range of proposals and initiatives by European states to cope with plummeting gas supplies from Russia, which once supplied 40 percent of Europe's needs, and rocketing prices. They have eased off this year's peaks but remain more than 200 percent higher than at the start of September 2021.Germany and Denmark oppose a cap, worried that it would make it difficult to buy the gas their economies need and dampen any incentive to reduce consumption.\n\nFrance's Emmanuel Macron to up Ukraine weapons deliveries after public criticism\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron announces an increase in military aid to Ukraine after criticism France wasn't pulling its weight. /Leonhard Foeger/Reuters\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron announces an increase in military aid to Ukraine after criticism France wasn't pulling its weight. /Leonhard Foeger/Reuters\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has announced that he will step up arms supplies to Ukraine in the wake of criticism that Paris wasn't doing enough to help the war effort since Russia's launched its attack on its neighbor eight months ago.\u00a0\"We will continue to support Ukraine from the financial, humanitarian, and military perspectives,\" the French president said.That pledge came on Thursday from Prague, as Macron attended a summit made up of 44 state leaders for the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community.\u00a0What is the European Political Community?World leaders in attendance discussed ways of moving forward while providing support to Kyiv in a unified position.The last few weeks have seen a number of diplomats level criticism at the French leader for what they say has been a lack of military assistance from France, with figures showing Paris has so far contributed just 2 percent of the total given to Kyiv. In comparison, the U.S. has given 49 percent, Poland 22 percent and Germany over 9 percent.\u00a0Analysts say those numbers do not paint an entirely accurate picture, though.\u00a0\"France has been criticized for a lack of support and there is some truth in that. But France hasn't published information on all the things it sends,\" says Yohann Michel, a military researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\u00a0\"These might not be tanks or armed people carriers, but they're equally important, with France sending things like counter-battery-radars and other electronic warfare equipment,\" he said.With the war in Ukraine expected to continue well into the near future, European nations are putting in an increased effort to cooperate further with other countries.\u00a0That has started with the unified show of force in Prague this week, as world leaders discussed the possible next steps against Russia after the EU laid out its eighth package of sanctions against Moscow.\"It's important to be realistic about what France can actually deliver,\" Michel said. \"Maybe we can't do enough now, so we need to make sure that we think about what we can do better in the future. I think that's the most important thing for French and Europeans to think about.\"Earlier this month, France released its budget bill proposing an additional \u20ac3 billion ($2.92bn) in defense spending. If approved, the military budget would be sitting at \u20ac43.9 billion ($4.28bn) for 2023 - an increase in defense spending for the sixth consecutive year.\n\nEU discusses further aid for Ukraine at summit in Prague: Scholz\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Friday that the EU Summit in Prague discussed further political, financial and military aid for Ukraine.The first meeting of the \"European Political Community\" started in the Czech capital Prague on Thursday.\n\nRussia says it will consider its own investigation into Nord Stream incidents\n\nRussia will consider its own investigation into the Nord Stream pipelines' leaks, as Denmark does not want Russia to be engaged in its examination, the Russian Embassy in Denmark said on its website on Friday.The Kremlin said Russia must be part of investigations into last week's explosions in the two Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. Russian energy giant Gazprom is a majority shareholder of Nord Stream AG, which owns and operates the vital pipelines that carry gas from Russia to Europe.Russia said Denmark's refusal to allow Russia to be part of the investigation undermines the reliability of any future results.\n\nGrossi confirms first rotation of IAEA mission to Zaporizhzhia\n\nRafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has confirmed that the first rotation of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine was complete and \"now a new reinforced team of IAEA safety, security, and safeguards experts is at the plant,\" the IAEA said in a tweet on Friday.\"Grossi said that the team will continue its indispensable mission and will support, once agreed, the nuclear safety and security protection zone around the site of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,\" it added.\n\nZelenskyy calls for more EU pressure on Russian energy sector\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday called on the EU to ramp up pressure on Russia's energy sector, a day after the EU imposed a fresh round of sanctions on Moscow.\"We must continue moving in this direction - the direction of pressure on the Russian energy sector, on this main source of income of the aggressor state,\" he said in a video address to an EU summit in Prague.\n\nEuropean Union (EU) leaders struggled Friday to bridge significant differences over a natural gas price cap as they met at Prague Castle to discuss how best to deal with a winter energy crunch.Fifteen EU states want a price cap on gas but did not agree on the details of how it should be done. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands oppose any cap, worried that it would make it difficult to buy the gas they need to keep their economies running and dampen any incentive to reduce consumption.The price cap is one of several measures the EU is preparing to contain an energy crisis in Europe that some fear could lead to rolling blackouts, factory shutdowns and a deep recession over the winter in economies already weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said a gas-price ceiling would endanger security of supply. \"So we cannot set the price so that no one would sell gas into Europe,\" he said.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said he hoped the \"last hurdles\" to a price cap would be overcome and the leaders should agree on a joint path of action to send two important messages.\u00a0\"One to the energy markets, to make it clear we no longer accept these prices, we will not continue to pay this market manipulation. Secondly, an important signal to our populations, to our companies, that we are going to tackle the problem at the root,\" he said.European Council President Charles Michel said no decisions were expected on Friday but hoped the discussion among leaders would lead to a deal when they next meet on October 20-21 in Brussels.\n\nPutin calls on measures to resolve 'tragic events' in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on working on measures to resolve \"tragic events\" that are happening in Ukraine and conflicts occurring in other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\u00a0Putin made the remarks at the informal summit meeting of heads of state of the CIS.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden made his stark warning about the threat of nuclear war./ Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden made his stark warning about the threat of nuclear war./ Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons in\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0has brought the world closer to 'Armageddon' than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, U.S. President Joe Biden said.\u00a0 READ MORE BELOW\u00b7\u00a0Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said remarks by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggesting NATO should launch preventive strikes on Russia confirmed the need for what it calls its \"special operation\" in\u00a0Ukraine.\u00a0\u00b7 Zelenskyy's spokesperson said the President was referring to imposing sanctions on Russia when he suggested preventive strikes were necessary to preclude any use of nuclear weapons.\u00b7 Two Russians fleeing military service have claimed asylum in the U.S. after arriving by boat in Alaska, authorities said.

On Wednesday, Germany said it would subsidize power bills next year by paying just under 13 billion euros ($12.8 billion) towards the usage fees charged by the four high-voltage transmission grid companies.The fees form part of electricity bills, accounting for around 10 percent of overall costs for retail customers and a third for industrial companies in sectors such as steel or chemicals.In a 10-point plan the IEA released in March on how to reduce Europe's reliance on Russia, the Paris-based organization suggested that the EU should turn to alternative sources of gas from the EU itself and countries such as Norway and Azerbaijan. Moreover, it added the EU should not enter new gas supply contracts with Russia.\"In the current context, the complete shutdown of Russian pipeline gas supplies to the European Union cannot be excluded ahead of the 2022-23 heating season \u2013 when the European gas market is at its most vulnerable,\" said the IEA's gas market report for the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThe European Council on Thursday adopted the eighth package of sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nDeadly missile attacks in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia have been followed up by another strike on the Ukrainian city, local officials said on Thursday.\u00a0The alleged bombardment came several hours after a Russian rocket strike that killed at least two people overnight in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, and damaged or destroyed several residential buildings and caused widespread fires, Regional Governor Oleksandr Starukh said early on Thursday.\u00a0The strikes came just a few hours after Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin declared to put \"the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine under Russian state control\" on Wednesday.\u00a0One woman died in the shelling, another one on the way to the hospital as a result of seven Russian strikes, Starukh revealed in a Telegram post.\u00a0\"At least five people are under the rubble of buildings,\" he said. \"Many people were saved. Among them is a 3-year-old girl, the child is being taken care of. A rescue operation continues.\"Russia has not yet responded to the allegations.Ukraine said Thursday its military had recaptured more than 400 square kilometers (155 square miles) in the southern region of Kherson in less than one week, after Moscow claimed to have incorporated the area.\u00a0\"The Armed Forces of Ukraine have liberated more than 400 square kilometers of the Kherson region since the beginning of October,\" Ukrainian southern army command spokeswoman Natalia Gumeniuk said in a briefing online.On Wednesday, with Russian forces retreating from front lines in the south and east, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address that Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka to the northeast of Kherson city had been \"liberated.\"At the United Nations, Russia is lobbying for a secret ballot instead of a public vote next week when the 193-member UN General Assembly considers whether to condemn its incorporation of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south after staging referendums there.Putin signed a law on Wednesday to accept the regions into Russia. Ukraine says it will never accept an illegal seizure of its territory by force. Kyiv and the West said the referendums were rigged votes held at gunpoint.The new law would take about 18 percent of Ukraine's territory into Russia. Putin said he wants to ensure Russia's security and protect Russian-speakers in Ukraine, while Kyiv accused Moscow of a land grab.Russia's move raises the possibility of an escalation in the war, as Putin and other officials have said they could use nuclear weapons to protect Russian territory. Yet Zelenskyy addressed pro-Moscow forces, telling them they had already lost.\n\n\"Ukrainians know what they are fighting for.

The river is enormously wide, and Ukraine has already destroyed the major crossings. The reports were the first to describe a rapid Ukrainian advance in the south of the country since the war began and came just a day after Ukraine routed Russian troops in the strategic position of Lyman.The advances in the east and the south - some of the biggest of the war so far - have all taken place in territory that President Vladimir Putin claimed to have become part of Russia on Friday, with a celebratory concert at the Kremlin.

Baltic island of Bornholm. /Danish Defense/AFP\n\nThe theory that the multiple ruptures in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines that run from Russia to Germany were part of a sabotage plot is growing. A gas leak from the Nord Stream 2 pipe was detected on Monday evening near the Danish Island of Bornholm after the pressure dropped significantly in one of the two tubes.Danish authorities have since detected what they say are three leaks in both Nord Stream lines. The ruptures in the Nord Stream 1 pipe have been found in both the Danish and Swedish sections of the tube, while the leak in Nord Stream 2 is in the Danish section.\u00a0All the leaks are concentrated in the area around Bornholm.The life and times of Queen Elizabeth IIA Swedish seismologist at Uppsala University says data recorded before the gas leaks were revealed shows two explosions that he believes are \"highly likely\" to be man-made.\u00a0Peter Schmidt said, \"the reason why we are fairly confident that these are explosions is mainly the amount of energy released and the short duration over which this energy was released. Had it have been some type of collapse, that is typically [over a] more extended time,\" in an interview released by AFP.\n\nThe company which operates the gas transit network say it is unclear when the system will work again. Danish energy authority Energinet said that breaks in undersea lines were extremely rare and has raised its alert level to amber, the second highest.Talk of sabotage has been rife, with German newspaper The Berlin Tagesspiegel quoting a source as saying, \"Our imagination no longer gives us a scenario that it is not a targeted attack.\"\u00a0German Green party Member Jurgen Tritten has also been quoted as saying he assumes a \"violent disturbance\" occurred. The German Federal Ministry of Economics refused to get drawn into the matter, saying, \"We do not participate in speculation.\"Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has revealed that Moscow is considering the possibility that the pipelines were deliberately ruptured.\"Now, no variant can be ruled out,\" Peskov told the Russian Interfax news agency. \"Obviously, there is a destruction of the line. And what is the reason for it? You cannot rule out any variant until the results of the investigations emerge.\"\u00a0Moscow is seeking to get to the bottom of what caused this. \"This is an absolutely unprecedented situation that needs to be clarified quickly,\" said Vladimir Putin's spokesman.Meanwhile, Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz has accused Russia of being behind a false flag attack on its pipeline.\"Unfortunately, our eastern neighbor is constantly pursuing an aggressive policy. If it is capable of an aggressive military policy in Ukraine, it is obvious that provocations cannot be ruled out, even in the sections that are in Western Europe,\" said Przydacz.As of Tuesday afternoon, both the company operating the pipeline and the authorities in Germany have maintained that they do not know what caused the drop in pressure or the leaks detected in both Nord Stream Pipelines.Nord Stream 2 never went into operation after it was finished. However, it was filled with gas in its final testing and certification phase. Nord Stream 1 provided gas to Germany until the end of August when Russian state energy giant Gazprom stopped deliveries partly because of maintenance and then altogether due to an oil leak at the Russian end of the system.\u00a0Western states have said that the justification is a pretence to try to hold Europe's gas market ransom.\n\nMeasurement stations in Sweden and Denmark registered powerful underwater blasts in areas of Nord Stream gas leaks on Monday, reported Swedish broadcaster SVT on Tuesday, citing the Swedish National Seismic Network.\"There is no doubt that these were explosions,\" Bjorn Lund, a seismologist from the network, told SVT.There were two blasts recorded shortly prior to the discovery of the three leaks on the pipelines linking Russia and Europe.The blasts took place near the location of the gas leaks off the coast of the Danish island of Bornholm, Peter Schmidt, a seismologist from Uppsala University, told AFP.Russia, which has slashed gas deliveries to Europe after the West imposed sanctions, said sabotage was a possibility and the incident undermined the continent's energy security.A senior Ukrainian official called it a Russian attack to destabilize Europe, without giving proof, according to a Reuters report.The Nord Stream pipelines have been flashpoints in an escalating energy war between European capitals and Moscow that has pummeled major Western economies, sent gas prices soaring and sparked a hunt for alternative energy supplies.\n\nRussia denies any plan to force overseas Russian citizens to return\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry has not sent any appeal to state authorities of Kazakhstan, Georgia or other countries regarding the forced return of Russian citizens present in those countries and had not prepared any and had no plan to do so, the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nNew Zealand announced new sanctions against 19 Russians on Tuesday, including the Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nMedvedev says Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons if necessary\n\nRussian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on Telegram on Tuesday that Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons \"if we or our allies are attacked using this type of weapon.

Russia and Belarus are close allies, with Russia having used bases in Belarus as a staging post for its troops, aircraft and equipment for its attack of Ukraine.\u00b7 Heavy fighting has seen more than 40 towns hit by Russian shelling in the past 24 hours, Ukraine officials have said. There have been five missile and 12 air strikes, as well as more than 83 attacks from multiple rocket-propelled grenades, the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said.\u00b7 Two drones launched by Russian forces into Ukraine's Odesa region hit military objects, causing a fire and setting off ammunition, Ukraine's southern command said on Monday. \"As a result of a large-scale fire and the detonation of ammunition, the evacuation of the civilian population was organized,\" it said on messaging app Telegram.\u00b7 Finland said on Monday it had recorded the year's busiest weekend in terms of Russians entering the country, after Moscow's military call-up announcement caused a rush for the border. \"Last weekend was the busiest weekend of the year for traffic on the eastern border,\" said Mert\u00a0Sasioglu of the Finnish border guard.\u00b7 Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin said he founded the Wagner Group, a private military company, in 2014, the first public confirmation of a link he has previously denied. \"I cleaned the old weapons myself, sorted out the bulletproof vests myself and found specialists who could help me with this. From that moment, on May 1, 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later came to be called the Wagner Battalion,\" Prigozhin said.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy said that he does not think Vladimir Putin is bluffing over use of nuclear weapons.

STR / AFP\n\nU.S. says it would act 'decisively' if nuclear weapons used in UkraineThe U.S. warned Moscow of \"catastrophic consequences\" if it uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine after Russia promised protection to regions that might join it following referendums. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. would respond to any Russian use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine.\"If Russia crosses this line, there will be catastrophic consequences for Russia,\" Sullivan told NBC television. \"The United States will respond decisively.\"Sullivan did not say how Washington would respond but said it had privately told Moscow \"in greater detail exactly what that would mean\".His comments followed Wednesday's thinly veiled nuclear threat by President Vladimir Putin, who said Russia would use any weapons to defend its territory.Asked at the weekend if Moscow would consider using nuclear weapons to defend newly joined regions, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russian territory, including that \"further enshrined\" in Russia's constitution in the future, was under the \"full protection of the state\".Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he did not believe Putin was bluffing when the Kremlin leader said Moscow would be ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia.Citizens in four regions of Ukraine were voting for a fourth day on Monday in the Russian-organized referendums that Kyiv and the West have branded a sham. They say the outcomes are pre-determined and even countries with close ties to Moscow such as Serbia and Kazakhstan say they will not recognize the results.But by incorporating the four regions - Luhansk and Donetsk in the east and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south - Moscow could portray Ukraine's efforts to retake them as attacks on Russia itself, a warning to Kyiv and its Western allies.The governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Gaidai, said Russian-backed officials were carrying ballot boxes from door to door, accompanied by security officials. Residents' names were taken down if they failed to vote correctly or refused to cast a ballot, he said.\"A woman walks down the street with what looks like a karaoke microphone telling everyone to take part in the referendum,\" the governor said in an interview posted online. \"Representatives of the occupation forces are going from apartment to apartment with ballot boxes. This is a secret ballot, right?\"The four regions represent about 15 percent of Ukraine, or roughly the size of Portugal. Russian forces do not control all the territory in those regions, where fierce fighting still rages. They would add to Crimea, an area nearly the size of Belgium that joined Russia in 2014 after a similar referendum there.Voting ends on Tuesday and Russia's parliament could then move swiftly to formalize the additional regions.\n\nU.S. commits $457.5m in new civilian security assistance for Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. committed $457.5 million in new civilian security assistance for Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken said on Monday.\n\nRussia says contacts with U.S. through ambassadors to be less intense\n\nContacts between Russia and U.S. through ambassadors won't be as intense as before, but communication channels must work, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Monday, the RIA news agency reported.\n\nWhat's next in the ongoing war in Ukraine?\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin announces the immediate partial military mobilization of Russian citizens.

READ MORE BELOW\u00b7 Voting in the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, around 15 percent of Ukrainian territory, will take place until Tuesday. If the referendums pass and the four areas are incorporated into Russia, Moscow could justify escalating attacks to defend its territory.\u00b7 Western leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York called for Russia to be held accountable for human rights violations in Ukraine. \"The very international order we've gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes. We can't let President Putin get away with it,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his colleagues.\u00a0\u00b7 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defended the war at the meeting, accusing its neighbor of committing atrocities. \"The intention of formenting of this conflict by the collective West remains unpunished. Of course you won't punish yourselves here,\" said Russia's top diplomat.\u00b7 A UN-mandated inquiry by the independent Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has concluded war crimes have been committed in the country, based on evidence gathered from four regions.\u00b7 Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has said any weapons, including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend territories incorporated into Russia from Ukraine.\u00b7 Some draft-age Russians have headed abroad to escape their country's biggest conscription drive since World War II. Prices for air tickets from Moscow are skyrocketing, but the Kremlin said reports of an exodus were \"exaggerated.\"\u00b7 An estimated 10,000 volunteers have already enlisted to the Russian armed forces without even waiting for their call-up papers, the country's General Staff has claimed.\u00b7 Russian security forces have detained at least 1,300 protesters against the draft, some of whom were given enlistment papers while in custody, a rights group said.\u00b7 Putin was \"pushed\" into the war on Ukraine to install a new government in Kyiv, according to former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, in comments likely to concern Western allies ahead of Italy's election on Sunday.\u00a0\u00b7 Russian-backed separatists said at least six civilians had been killed and six wounded in a Ukrainian missile attack on a market in central Donetsk, while in the Russian-held southern city of Melitopol, a blast hit a crowded market, reportedly killing three soldiers.\u00a0\u00b7 The Ukrainian prosecutor's office said Russian mortar bombs killed two people and wounded six in Toretsk town in the Donetsk region.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks at the Security Council meeting on the Ukraine conflict. /Evan Schneider/UN/AFP\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks at the Security Council meeting on the Ukraine conflict. /Evan Schneider/UN/AFP\n\nVoting began on Friday in four Ukrainian regions held mainly by Russian forces, the first step in what could mean Moscow absorbs 15 percent of Ukraine's territory, a move the West says is in violation of international law and a major escalation of the conflict.After nearly seven months of fighting, President Vladimir Putin said that he would support the regions' votes on joining Russia, signaling a significant step in the Kremlin's campaign to \"liberate\" areas of Ukraine's east and south by integrating them into its territory.\u00a0The voting, which the West and Ukraine say is a sham conducted under military occupation, began on Friday and will end on Tuesday, with results expected soon afterwards.Voting is taking place in self-styled Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, which Putin recognized as independent just before the conflict, alongside the southern Russian-controlled areas of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\"All of us have been waiting for a referendum on joining Russia for eight long years,\" said Leonid Pasechnik, the Russian-backed leader of Luhansk. \"We have already become part of Russia. There remains only a small matter \u2013 to win (the war).\"\"We are returning home,\" said the Russian-backed leader of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin. \"Donbas is Russia.\"The outcomes of the referendums are almost certain to support joining Russia, which will likely be followed by a quickly implemented legal claim, similar to what took place in Crimea in 2014, a process which took just a matter of days.\n\nA boy wearing a T-shirt with the letter 'Z', the tactical insignia of Russian troops in Ukraine, and holding a flag of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in Moscow. /Alexander Nemenov/AFP\n\nA boy wearing a T-shirt with the letter 'Z', the tactical insignia of Russian troops in Ukraine, and holding a flag of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in Moscow. /Alexander Nemenov/AFP\n\nAs voting got underway, Ivan Fedorov, the ousted Ukrainian mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol, said on Telegram that a loud explosion was heard by residents in the city centre at 7 a.m. local time. \"People are afraid to leave their homes,\" Fedorov said.Though Russia recognized Ukraine's post-Soviet borders under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Putin considers large parts of eastern and southern Ukraine to be Russian possessions that were lost due to errors by Soviet leaders Vladimir Lenin and Nikita Khrushchev.Ukraine says it will never accept Russian control of any of its territory and will fight until the last Russian soldier is ejected.\u00a0\"The Kremlin is organizing sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine,\" U.S. President Joe Biden told the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. \"Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine,\" said Biden, who cast the war as part of a global contest between democracy and autocracy.It is unclear exactly how the votes will work in a conflict zone when so many people have been displaced. Russia controls most of Luhansk and Kherson, around 66 percent of Zaporizhzhia and 60 percent of Donetsk.

It is imperative that the parties concerned resume dialogues as soon as possible, integrate legitimate concerns into negotiations and put feasible options on the table so as to bring about outcomes for peace, Wang said.Second, joint efforts must be made to ease tensions. All parties concerned should exercise restraint and refrain from words and deeds that aggravate confrontation, Wang said, adding that the international community should play a constructive role in helping cool the situation.\u00a0There is no room for trial and error as far as the safety of nuclear facilities is concerned, and any risk of accidents must be avoided, Wang said.Third, the humanitarian situation must be alleviated. Wang said the international humanitarian law should be observed to minimize civilian casualties.\u00a0International investigations should be objective and fair, based on facts and avoid politicization, said Wang, adding that UN humanitarian agencies should be supported in continuing to provide assistance to the affected people.\u00a0Fourth, full efforts must be made to contain spillover effects.

Independent news claimed some of those arrested were served summons to report to military enlistment offices on Thursday, the first full day of conscription.Flights out of Russia sold out after Putin's announcement.\"Every normal person is (concerned), it's horrible,\" said one man, identifying himself only as Sergey, disembarking in Belgrade after a flight from Moscow. \"It is ok to be afraid of the war and such things.\"Ukrainian President Zelenskyy urged the UN on Wednesday to create a special tribunal and strip Moscow of its UN Security Council veto power as a diplomatic showdown loomed on Thursday in New York.\"A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand just punishment,\" said the president to world leaders at the annual UN General Assembly on Wednesday. The Security Council has been unable to take meaningful action on Ukraine because Russia can use its veto to block most resolutions passing on the conflict.

The mobilization, the first since the Soviet Union fought Nazi Germany in World War Two, begins immediately, but it will take time before Russia's new troops arrive in Ukraine.\n\nThe decision to draft soldiers coincides with major Russian territorial losses in Ukraine's northeast, and the move from Ukrainian separatist leaders to hold referendums on joining Russia - the first step to formal annexation of an area of Ukraine the size of Hungary.Putin gave his explicit support to the votes on Wednesday, following his recognition of the self-styled Donetsk (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republics (LPR) just before Moscow launched its attack in February. Russian-installed officials in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions have also asked for referendums.\"We will support the decision on their future, which will be made by the majority of residents in the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson,\" Putin said. \"We cannot, have no moral right to hand over people close to us to the executioners, we cannot but respond to their sincere desire to determine their own fate.\"The West and Ukraine have condemned the referendum plan as an illegal sham and vowed never to accept its results, with France's President Emmanuel Macron saying the plans were \"a parody.\"However, if the territories are integrated in Russia, it would give Moscow the excuse to use nuclear weapons if it felt it was necessary: the country's nuclear doctrine allows the use of such weapons if weapons of mass destruction are used against it or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons.\n\nRussia's defense ministry on Wednesday claimed that a Ukrainian large-caliber shell had damaged a technical water pipe at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported.Ukraine has not responded to the claim.\n\nOil prices surge more than 2% as Putin mobilises more troops\n\nAn aerial view of a petroleum terminal is seen in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., May 11, 2022. /CFP\n\nAn aerial view of a petroleum terminal is seen in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., May 11, 2022. /CFP\n\nOil jumped more than 2 percent on Wednesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilization, escalating the conflict and raising concerns of tighter oil and gas supplies.Brent crude futures rose $2.28, or 2.5 percent, to $92.90 a barrel by 0707 GMT after falling $1.38 the previous day.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $86.16 a barrel, up $2.22, or 2.6 percent.Putin said he had signed a decree on partial mobilization beginning on Wednesday.The escalation will lead to increased uncertainty over Russian energy supplies, said Warren Patterson, head of commodities research at ING.\"The move could possibly lead to calls for more aggressive action against Russia in terms of sanctions from the West,\" he said.Oil soared and touched a multi-year high in March after the Ukraine conflict broke out.European Union sanctions banning seaborne imports of Russian crude will come into force on December 5.\"It seems like a knee-jerk reaction to a sliver of news and would be liable to further recalibration in the coming hours,\" said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore.Meanwhile, the U.S. said that it did not expect a breakthrough on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal at this week's U.N. General Assembly, reducing the prospects of a return of Iranian barrels to the international market.The OPEC+ producer grouping \u2013 the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and associates including Russia \u2013 is now falling a record 3.58 million barrels per day short of its production targets, or about 3.5 percent of global demand.

The role of gas in Europe has fundamentally changed, and so has the outlook for a gas-heavy portfolio. As a result, the business case for an integrated group is no longer viable,\" said Markus Rauramo, CEO and president of Fortum, according to the statement.\"Today's agreement provides clarity on the ownership structure, allows us to continue our business and to fulfill our role as a system-critical energy supplier,\" Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach said in an online statement released on Wednesday.The transaction is subject to regulatory clearances at Uniper's extraordinary general meeting, slated for the fourth quarter of the year. Completion is currently expected by year-end, according to Fortum's statement.As one of Europe's largest gas companies, Uniper is also Germany's largest importer of Russian gas. When gas prices skyrocketed this year, Uniper had to replace gas deliveries with expensive supplies from the open market due to a lack of gas supplies from Russia.Since the European energy crisis escalated, Uniper has accumulated close to 8.5 billion euros in gas-related losses.As a result, the German government in July announced the stabilization package of measures for Uniper to safeguard Germany's energy supply.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Wednesday that President Vladimir Putin's decree on partial mobilization would see 300,000 additional personnel called up to serve in Russia's military campaign in Ukraine.In an interview with Russian state television, Shoigu said that students and those who served as conscripts would not be called up, and that the majority of Russia's millions-strong reserves would not be drafted.\n\nUkraine accused Russian forces of shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday, damaging the communication equipment of power unit No. 6.The block transformer and the power unit\u2019s transformers were disconnected as a result of the attack.

Russia said on Wednesday a large-caliber shell had damaged a technical water pipe at the plant, which is occupied by Russian troops.\u00a0Putin's words also hit global markets, which have see-sawed since the start of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The euro tumbled 0.7 percent against the dollar, European stock markets opened sharply lower, and investors piled into safe-haven bonds, pushing yields on German and U.S. government debt down.\u00a0Oil and gas prices also rose on global energy markets.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 70 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $82.64 per barrel.Prices drew support from Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat to halt the country's oil and gas exports if price caps are imposed by European buyers.The European Union proposed capping Russian gas prices only hours later, raising the risk of rationing in some of the world's richest countries this winter if Moscow carries out its threat. Russia's state-run energy giant Gazprom\u00a0has already halted flows from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, cutting off a substantial percentage of supply to Europe.The oil price trend is being shaped by \"various external forces such as the energy battle between Western countries and Russia,\" said analysts from Haitong Futures in a note.The potential impact of any deal or reinstating an accord between the West and Iran on Tehran's nuclear program would also be significant, they noted.

The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a powerful speech this week at the Eastern Economic Forum. He highlighted how the Russian economy remains stable, even though the Western powers have imposed stiff sanctions against Moscow. Meanwhile, the Russian oil and gas sector is booming with high prices, as well as shifting more energy deliveries to the Asia and Middle East markets. Putin also raised concerns over the belligerent aims of U.S. foreign policy.The Western powers led by Brussels, London and Washington have been seized by \"sanctions fever,\" hoping to crush the Russian spirit while Moscow has been involved with its \"special military operations\" in Ukraine since February 24. The West has blocked imports of microchips into Russia, barred international bank transfers via the SWIFT system, and has tightened restrictions on Russian exports of food and energy products.Despite being isolated, Putin announced that Russia's annual GDP is forecast to drop only by two percent by the end of the year, while the central government's budget is on pace to hit a record-setting surplus.\"We have not lost anything and will not lose anything,\" said Putin. \"Everything that is unnecessary, harmful and everything that prevents us from moving forward will be rejected.\"\"In terms of what we have gained, I can say that the main gain has been the strengthening of our sovereignty, and this is the inevitable result of what is happening now,\" Putin added. \"This will ultimately strengthen our country from within.\"Does it herald the emergence of a multi-polar new age, and the coming end of the present-day uni-polar global order dominated by Washington?The Eastern Economic Forum is being held in Vladivostok, located on Russia's southeastern seaboard, serving as a cross-border trading hub for the nation's Siberian region that is rich in natural resources, particularly in oil, gas, coal, minerals, metals, timber and seafood.China, the world's second-largest economy and bordering Vladivostok, has a large manufacturing base that requires a massive influx of natural resources to sustain the supply chains of its factories, warehouses and logistics services companies.\n\nA logo of Russia's energy giant Gazprom at a petrol station in Moscow, Russia, September 1, 2022. /CFP\n\nA logo of Russia's energy giant Gazprom at a petrol station in Moscow, Russia, September 1, 2022. /CFP\n\nAccording to media reports, on Tuesday, China's state-owned energy company China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) announced a joint agreement to build a natural gas pipeline with Russia's state-run energy giant Gazprom that will run from Siberia to northeastern China. The Russian gas payments by China will go 50/50 rubles and yuan while foregoing the U.S. dollar, TASS reported Gazprom as saying in a press release.Additionally, the nations in South and Southeast Asia are eager to pursue more expansive industrialization, urbanization and modernization drives.As such, Russia's bounty of natural resources can complement Asian economies. Many Asian countries are acting more pragmatic in regards to opposing sanctions on Russia as they prefer a more neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine conflict. They see little to gain by inflicting self-harm on their respective economies just so they can please the U.S., United Kingdom and European Union.Ordinary Europeans are suffering heavily during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. An economic forecast the European Commission released in July projected that the EU economy will grow by 2.7 percent in 2022 and\u00a01.5 percent in 2023, with record-high inflation to peak later this year. The European governments can continue to blindly follow Washington's demands to support Kyiv, but at what costs?German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is quoted as saying, \"yes, our citizens are suffering, but they will have to suffer because we will support Ukraine no matter what.\"Since the European Coal and Steel Community was set up some 70 years ago, seeking European strategic autonomy has long been in the bloc leaders' blood.Apparently, European politicians of this generation put their people's livelihood aside while following Washington's suit. Yet Russia will still prevail as an independent sovereign state in the years to come.\n\nGrains to be shipped are loaded onto a ship at Port of Rostov-on-Don in Russia, August 17, 2022. /CFP\n\nGrains to be shipped are loaded onto a ship at Port of Rostov-on-Don in Russia, August 17, 2022. /CFP\n\nSenior United Nations (UN) and Russian officials met in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss Russian complaints that Western sanctions were impeding its grain and fertilizer exports despite a UN-brokered deal to boost Russian and Ukrainian shipments of the commodities.The UN, T\u00fcrkiye, Ukraine and Russia agreed on July 22 on what was described by UN chief Antonio Guterres as a package deal to restart Ukraine's Black Sea grain and fertilizer exports and facilitate Russian shipments.Senior UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin for a \"positive\" discussion in Geneva on Wednesday, said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\"The discussions are going on in a very constructive, professional level,\" he said. \"The challenges are fairly clear, but I'm not going to get into the detail of what has been discussed around that table.\"Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Tuesday called for the removal of \"logistic sanctions that prevent the free access of Russian grain and fertilizers to world markets.\"Moscow's complaints come ahead of likely discussions aimed at extending the initial 120-day deal allowing Ukraine's Black Sea exports.The aim of the package agreement was to help ease a global food crisis that the UN says was worsened by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and pushed tens of millions more people into hunger. Ukraine and Russia are both major wheat exporters.\n\nThe Swiss-based unit of Russian gas giant Gazprom, which built the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, has received a provisional extension of its debt restructuring moratorium until January 10, 2023, court filings showed on Thursday.Court filings published by the Swiss Official Gazette noted that the extension for Nord Stream 2 AG had originally been set to expire on September 10.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday accused the West of staging \"provocations\" against Russia that have forced it to cut energy supplies to Europe.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry blacklisted the top military leadership of the European Union, high-ranking security officials of the EU countries, and representatives of the European defense industry involved in supplying weapons to Ukraine, RIA reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe European Commission will propose a price cap on Russian gas, alongside measures including a mandatory EU cut in electricity use during peak hours, and a cap on the revenues of non-gas power generators, the bloc's chief Ursula\u00a0von der Leyen said on Wednesday.\n\nEU proposes additional \u20ac5 billion in financial aid to Ukraine\n\nThe EU on Wednesday proposed additional five billion euros in financial aid to Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula\u00a0von der Leyen\u00a0tweeted.\n\nPutin: Russia will post budget surplus this year, GDP to decline 'around 2%'\n\nRussia will post a budget surplus this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.Speaking at the 7th Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Putin said Russia's budget surplus would come in at 1.5 trillion rubles ($24.5 billion) in 2022, while GDP would fall by \"around 2% or a little more.\"\n\nBrussels is working on a \u20ac200 a megawatt hour limit to the price of electricity generated by non-gas power producers as part of efforts to quell the EU's energy crisis, the Financial Times reported.In a draft of proposals seen by the news outlet, the European Commission said it recommended member states cap the price of electricity from producers such as wind farms and nuclear and coal plants, all of which are set by the high price of gas, at \u20ac200 a megawatt hour (MWh).\n\nLithuania, Latvia, Estonia agree 'in principle' to restrict movement of Russian citizens\n\nLatvian foreign minister said on Wednesday Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \"reached agreement in principle\" to restrict movement of Russian citizens through their borders with Russia and Belarus.\n\nThe Nord Stream 1 Baltic Sea pipeline and the transfer station of the OPAL gas pipeline, the Baltic Sea Pipeline Link, in Lubmin, Germany, July 20, 2022. /CFP\n\nThe Nord Stream 1 Baltic Sea pipeline and the transfer station of the OPAL gas pipeline, the Baltic Sea Pipeline Link, in Lubmin, Germany, July 20, 2022. /CFP\n\nEditor's note:\u00a0Bobby Naderi is a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television, and a documentary filmmaker. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.Moscow has seemingly warned it will not turn on Europe's main gas pipeline until the \"collective West\" lifts its financial sanctions against Russia.The move follows the Nord Stream 1 pipeline allegedly shutting down for \"maintenance,\" but reports from Interfax indicate Moscow will not be turning the gas back on until demands are met. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, says the shutdown is due to Western sanctions against Moscow.\u00a0Amid the speculation, it seems so obvious that financial and economic sanctions on Russia have brought hell and high water to Europe. The collective punishment of all Russians, be they pro or anti-Putin, has also failed to persuade the Kremlin to modify its behavior. The energy-rich country is not fragile, and Russia changing its policy over Ukraine or NATO is only a speculative possibility.Western leaders and pundits would like us to believe that the written rules of engagement in Ukraine may never change, and that Europe can \u2013 and must \u2013 win the energy war. They admit victory will be costly, but \"the EU has to free itself from Russia's chokehold,\" and must resist \"Putin's blackmail.\"That's just a fool's rant as these are just distractions rather than guideposts. Try to take this in for a moment. Sharply rising energy prices have already led to high inflation across Europe. There are signs and credible reports that the EU cannot endure a winter without Russian gas. No one should ever ignore the ongoing disruption to industrial activity, nor the impact of soaring energy prices on poorer households.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently said the EU may deal with an energy crisis, and told Europeans to expect a difficult winter. Although Gazprom plans to provide Europe with 42.4 million cubic meters of gas, winter is still coming and will be harsh. This is while there's virtually no way to escape a Europe-wide recession. Many economists and business leaders consider it likely. \u00a0Following Peskov's statements, Europe's gas futures markets showed significant pain during trading sessions. This could be not just a present reality, but the EU's future for untold months to come. It's worthwhile to enumerate that this makes the sanctions doctrine a short-sighted and self-defeating shell game \u2013 subject to no effective oversight by anyone other than its own architects.In the continent itself, the architects of sanctions have produced more anarchy than order, more energy crises than tranquility, and more blowbacks than market stability. The world community is in the know that this is not the answer to Europe's hardships. It is a galling position to pretend financial and economic sanctions can eventually provide one.In such a context, no mainstream media has bothered to serve the public much better by focusing on what's really going on behind the scenes of the world\u2019s most popular reality show \u2013 the jingoistic bombast by Washington and Brussels. In most cases, the truth is little more than a footnote in the news. The idea is to try to make sure sanctions-friendly politicians capture the headlines and are top of the news.\n\nA view of the business tower Lakhta Centre, the headquarters of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom in St. Petersburg, Russia, April 27, 2022. /CFP\n\nA view of the business tower Lakhta Centre, the headquarters of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom in St. Petersburg, Russia, April 27, 2022. /CFP\n\nThe global and the local in today's world are virtually indistinguishable. Face it, there are compelling enough reasons for Russia, Ukraine and the related powers to conclude an uneasy peace. The endless superpower struggle for dominance over Eurasia plus an increasingly militarized commitment to Ukraine have led to economic turmoil and staggering increases in the price of basic foods across Europe and faraway lands.\u00a0The one thing that all parties can agree on is that the strategy of endless hostility amid a deepening energy crisis has come with an expensive price tag. The hard and bitter way ahead is a return to negotiations, even if there's little guarantee that it will resolve any of the issues that brought them into the current conflict.Western powers can rely on prohibitive sanctions and arms transfers as a preferred policy and in a staggering fashion, but it is the European people and companies that will continue to feel the pinch, leading many to wonder whether \"the most impactful, coordinated, and wide-ranging economic restrictions in history\" has what it takes to fatally cripple Russia's economy. In retrospect, Russia has continued to sell oil and gas. Driving business to non-EU markets has been the biggest escape clause of collective self-delusion in the West.The Western alliance needs not go wrong in its efforts to end the devastating, globally disruptive conflict in Ukraine. Matters need not end there. From a pragmatic perspective, what the alliance needs is keeping the focus solely on how it can slow the carnage and avoid a European recession caused by banning Russian gas.It's about time to figure out diplomatic responses that are not military or financial, from economic sanctions and trade embargoes to the confiscation of Russian assets and the increasingly massive shipment of arms to the embattled Ukrainians.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Wednesday that Moscow has done everything it can to ensure that Ukraine is able to export grain.He said that problems on the global food market are likely to intensify and that a humanitarian catastrophe is looming.Speaking at the plenary session of the 7th Eastern Economic Forum, Putin noted that almost all the grain exported from Ukraine went to EU countries instead of the poorest nations.Putin also said that he will discuss limiting grain exports from Ukraine to Europe with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Exports of grain across the Black Sea ports resumed after Kyiv and Moscow inked a deal with the United Nations and T\u00fcrkiye acting as guarantors in July.More than two million tonnes of grain and food items have been exported under the deal since August, according to Turkish authorities.Ukraine's agriculture minister said on Wednesday it was not aware of any formal steps taken by Russia to amend the terms of the deal, which remains the only significant diplomatic breakthrough in the six-month conflict.\n\nRussia has requested \"clarifications\" from the UN nuclear watchdog over its report on the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday.In a report released on Tuesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a demilitarized zone to be created around the plant, which has come under shelling in recent weeks.Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks, which have raised fears of an accident at Europe's largest atomic power station.\n\nPutin: Russia moving away from \"untrustworthy\" U.S. dollar, euro and pound\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a plenary session of the 2022 Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) in Vladivostok, Russia, September 7, 2022. /Reuters\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a plenary session of the 2022 Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) in Vladivostok, Russia, September 7, 2022. /Reuters\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said the world is losing confidence in the U.S. dollar, euro and pound and that Russia is gradually cutting down its usage of these currencies.\"In an attempt to resist the course of history, Western countries have undermined the key pillars of the world economic system, which has been built over centuries,\" Russian news agency TASS quoted Putin as he was addressing the seventh Eastern Economic Forum held in Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok.\"Before our eyes, confidence in the dollar, euro, and pound sterling as currencies for payments, storing reserves, nominate assets has been lost. We are gradually moving away from the use of such untrustworthy, compromised currencies,\" he said.Putin also reportedly accused Western countries of trying to maintain a world order that is beneficial only to them.He said that the \"sanctions fever\" of the West is a threat to the whole world, and these policies were catalyzed by the \"elusive dominance\" of the U.S. in the world.Putin noted that although the Russian economy was coping with what he termed \"financial and technological aggression of the West,\" he acknowledged that some industries and regions have faced difficulties.Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in February, Russia has been moving away from the U.S.-dollar payment system in the face of Western sanctions.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, China's state-owned energy company China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) announced it has signed a supplementary agreement, on China-Russian eastern route natural gas purchase and sale, with Russia's state-run energy giant Gazprom.CNPC Chairman Dai Houliang and Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller discussed extensive cooperation in the natural gas sector, according to an announcement on CNPC's website.Payments for Russian gas by China will be made in rubles and yuan instead of U.S. dollars, TASS reported Gazprom as saying in a statement.Miller said the new payment mechanism was \"mutually beneficial, timely, reliable and practical solution,\" saying he believes it would \"simplify payments, become an excellent example for other countries, and jump-start our economies.\"The eastern route of the China-Russia natural gas pipeline began operations in 2019.Since March, major Russian banks, including the country's second-largest lender VTB, have been banned from using SWIFT, a global financial artery that allows cross-border payments, as part of Western-led sanctions.\u00a0VTB announced on Tuesday that it will launch money transfers to China in yuan, bypassing the SWIFT system.Read more: Russia will respond to oil price caps by redirecting supplies, says energy minister\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Myanmar's Min Aung Hlaing during a

establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in southern Ukraine.\"The IAEA is ready to start immediately the consultations leading to the urgent establishment of such a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the ZNPP,\" the agency said in a report after the visit of its mission to the plant.Rafael\u00a0Grossi, director-general of the IAEA, also briefed the latest situation and the body's findings on the ZNPP to a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting on Tuesday.\"This [the proposal] is based on the findings from our mission to the power plant there, outlined in our new report,\" he told the meeting, \"The current situation is untenable and the best action to ensure the safety and security of Ukraine's nuclear facilities and its people would be for this armed conflict to end now.\"\n\nThe IAEA report called the shelling at or near the ZNPP \"deeply troubling for nuclear safety and security at the facility,\" but did not name who is responsible.\u00a0Both Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling, which took place again Tuesday despite the UN watchdog's recommendations.Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya, who attended Tuesday's UNSC meeting, said Russia needs more time to study the IAEA report about the ZNPP and is waiting for details on a proposal for a security zone.He said that Russia does not use the ZNPP as a military base and called on the UNSC to condemn Ukrainian provocations at the plant.\u00a0\"If the provocations by the Kyiv regime continue, there is no guarantee that there won't be serious consequences, and the responsibility for that lies fully with Kyiv and its Western backers and all other members of Security Council,\" he said while expressing regret that the IAEA did not blame Ukraine for the attacks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, commenting on the report, welcomed the fact that the document noted the Russian military occupation of the plant, and said that if the proposed security zone was aimed at demilitarizing \"the territory of the nuclear power plant ... then we can support it.\"\n\nA view of the No.5 reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Energodar, Ukraine, August 3, 2022. /CFP\n\nA view of the No.5 reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in

Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in a report released on Tuesday.The report outlines the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine after the IAEA delegation's visit to examine the ZNPP in southern Ukraine in early September.In the report, the IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid further damage to the plant and associated facilities to ensure the safety of the operating staff and maintain the physical integrity to support safe and secure operation.The IAEA said some repairs had already been carried out or were in progress at the plant and that further work would be needed to repair all of the damage.The team observed the presence of Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment at various locations at the plant, including several military trucks on the ground floor of the Unit 1 and Unit 2 turbine halls and military vehicles stationed under the overpass connecting the reactor units.Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling around the plant several times since the Russian forces took control of it since March.\u00a0A Chinese representative to the United Nations on Tuesday reiterated support for the efforts made by the IAEA and called for the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine.Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told a UN Security Council briefing that China is pleased with the positive progress made by the IAEA delegation.\"We support continued presence of the IAEA experts at the ZNPP and hope that the resident experts can provide continuous, steady and professional technical support to guarantee the safety and security of the nuclear facilities,\" Geng said.Geng also said China urges relevant parties to avoid all actions that endanger the safety and security of nuclear facilities and refrain from repeated tests on the edge of danger.\"We once again call on all parties to adopt a responsible approach to promote the de-escalation of the situation, work to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine, work together to build regional peace and tranquility, and jointly maintain global security and stability.\"\n\nThe European Commission on Tuesday proposed fully suspending the EU's \"Visa Facilitation Agreement\" with Russia, according to a press release.\u00a0\"The proposal to suspend the Visa Facilitation Agreement will put an end to all facilitations for Russian citizens applying for a short-stay visa to the Schengen area,\" the release said.In practice, Russian applicants will face more restrictive rules on multiple-entry visas and a longer list of supporting documents.The European Council will examine the proposal and decide whether to adopt it.The EU-Russia Visa Facilitation

The EU will instead opt to complicate the application, making tourist visas more cumbersome and expensive for Russians.Countries calling for the ban include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands, but the move is opposed by France and Germany who argue that such action could have unintended consequences.\u00a0Paris and Berlin previously argued that a complete ban could lead to dissidents and opponents of the Moscow government being unable to travel to Europe when fleeing from the country.\u00a0In a memo seen by Politico, France and Germany went further today, saying they wanted to \"maintain a legal framework that allows in particular students, artists, scholars, professionals \u2014 independent of whether they are at risk of prosecution on political grounds \u2014 to travel to the EU.\"\u00a0Supporters of the ban make the case that the move would both put pressure on Russia, and stop the unconscionable idea of Russians enjoying holidays across the continent. \u00a0The hope is that a ban would inconvenience influential and wealthy Russians, who would in turn put pressure on Moscow to find a compromise, with Estonian Prime Minister Kalas saying that \"even in autocracies, citizens are still responsible for their country's deeds.\"Denmark's foreign minister added that he finds it \"deeply provocative that Russian tourists can spend their vacation in Europe, while Ukrainian cities are being shelled and destroyed, and war crimes are being conducted.\"While a deal on a full-scale ban of Russian tourists seems unlikely, a possible compromise agreement could be within reach.\u00a0The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell hinted that despite the opposition to a ban, the bloc could move to suspend its visa facilitation agreement with Moscow, which has expedited Russian visa applications in the past, making the process more cumbersome and potentially more expensive for Russian tourists.\u00a0Despite this, Finland's foreign minister said that they would likely \"come back to these visa issues because during the autumn, when it will be difficult to identify new possible sanctions against Russia.\" \u00a0While a Russian tourist ban probably won't be agreed as things stand, supporters of the idea also seem reluctant to settle for a softer compromise, meaning the debate will likely rumble on for weeks to come.\n\nFrench PM Borne said the drop in gas imports could also be an 'opportunity.' /Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters\n\nFrench PM Borne said the drop in gas imports could also be an 'opportunity.' /Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters\n\nRussia has further reduced its gas deliveries to France, in a move which will deepen winter energy supply concerns.The French energy company Engie says that Russian gas giant Gazprom has made \"additional, immediate reductions\" in its gas deliveries.The drop in supplies is being blamed on a dispute over contracts.Engie's deliveries from Gazprom have already decreased substantially since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nRussia is accused of 'weaponizing' energy supplies with periodic shut-offs of gas pipeline supplies to Europe.\"Russia is using gas as a weapon of war,\" Agnes Pannier-Runacher, France's energy transition minister, told France Inter radio.Despite the cut, the head of France's energy regulatory commission said the agency is \"not too worried\" about the supply squeeze. French gas reserves are currently more than 90 percent full and should be entirely filled by the beginning of October.The cut in gas deliveries comes after a warning on Monday from the French prime minister about the risk of energy rationing this winter. PM Elisabeth Borne urged companies to take steps to reduce their consumption, saying \"it is the only way to succeed. It is also a historic opportunity to live better.\"\"It is no longer time to wait,\" she continued. \"It is no longer time for half measures. It is no longer time for 'everyone for themselves.'

Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia's purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,\" Guterres said.Zelenskyy said he agreed to the parameters of a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.However, Ivan Nechaev, deputy director of the Information and Publishing Division of Russian Foreign Ministry, said Guterres' proposal was infeasible as Ukraine organized multiple provocations and was unable to control its socialist groups.\"Erdogan said the leaders discussed using the positive atmosphere created by the UN-brokered grain export deal to establish lasting peace. He also urged efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine crisis through diplomatic means, and said T\u00fcrkiye will provide all necessary help to re-build Ukraine.\n\n'This is our battlefield': Ukrainian surgeon treating war injuries with free reconstruction procedures\n\nReconstructive procedures normally cost thousands of dollars but Tumbashyan and his team have been offering cosmetic reconstructive surgery to victims of the conflict for free. /Stephanie Freid/CGTN\n\nReconstructive procedures normally cost thousands of dollars but Tumbashyan and his team have been offering cosmetic reconstructive surgery to victims of the conflict for free. /Stephanie Freid/CGTN\n\nLarissa was in a deep sleep when rockets hit her neighborhood in Odesa at 1 a.m. on July 1.\u00a0\"I could hear my son scream, \u2018Mom run!\u2019.

The reactor is well protected. It has a powerful body and a reinforced concrete shell. The reactor cooling system can be damaged as a result of which in principle, a rather severe accident is possible,\" radiochemist Boris Zhukov expressed his concern,\u00a0adding that unstable radionuclides, such as iodine-131 and cesium-137, would leak.The plant, controlled by Russian forces since March, has come under fire repeatedly in recent weeks, with both Ukraine and Russia blaming each other for the attacks.\u00a0Russia on Thursday said the shelling was a \"provocation\" timed to coincide with a visit to Ukraine by U.N.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has continued to operate by Ukraine staff since Russia's control, has six nuclear reactors and generates about 25 percent of Ukraine's total electricity generation.Ukraine set up a crisis center to deal with the possible emergency situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukrinform reported on Wednesday, citing the country's Energy Minister Herman Galushchenko.The crisis headquarters will work round the clock to monitor the situation at the nuclear power plant, Galushchenko said.\u00a0In early August, Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the plant is \"completely out of control\" under the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and called on the two sides to prove an inspection and repairs by IAEA experts.In a statement on Thursday, Russia's Defense Ministry said there are no Russian heavy weapons at the Russian-controlled nuclear reactor complex, or in nearby districts, while\u00a0Ukraine has said that Russia has deployed artillery in and around the plant.Guterres has called for the establishment of a demilitarized zone around the plant.\"We are talking about the security of the world, not just the security of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and neighboring countries,\"\u00a0Martinique, a volunteer in humanitarian work in\u00a0Enerhodar, told CMG.\n\nUN chief to meet with Ukrainian, Turkish presidents in Lviv\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Thursday, according to RIA.\n\n\u2022 Russia's foreign ministry has rejected a proposal by UN chief Antonio Guterres to demilitarize the area around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying it would make the facility \"more vulnerable\".\u00a0\u2022 Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after talks with the UN head in Lviv that the organization must ensure Zaporizhzhia's security, as Moscow and Kyiv continue to blame each other for shelling at the site which officials have warned could lead to a Chernobyl-style nuclear disaster. \"This deliberate terror on the part of the aggressor can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world,\" the president wrote on Telegram.\u2022 Guterres also used the occasion to urge Russia and Ukraine to show a \"spirit of compromise\" and ensure the continued success of a UN-brokered deal that has allowed Kyiv to resume grain exports from its Black Sea ports.\u2022 Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who was meeting with Zelenskyy and Guterres in Ukraine, said they discussed possible ways of ending the conflict, adding that he would raise the issue of exchanging prisoners of war with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"We attach great importance to this issue...of what happened to the exchange of these captives,\" said the leader.\u2022 Three civilians were killed and more than a dozen wounded in a pre-dawn rocket attack on Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv.

It became the biggest warship to be sunk in combat for 40 years.One source said it was \"normal\" that the appointment of a new commander was not publicly announced considering it was wartime.\u00a0The previous Black Sea fleet chief, Osipov, 49, had been in charge since May 2019, according to his official biography on the defense ministry website.His replacement, Sokolov, 60, had extensive experience of commanding minesweeping vessels and units in the 1980s and 1990s, then rose through a series of posts in the Pacific and Northern Fleets, serving as deputy commander in the latter.

He said the decision had come after an influx of Russian tourists started using Finland and its Helsinki-Vantaa airport as a gateway towards European holiday destinations, after Russia lifted pandemic-related border restrictions a month ago.\"And this maybe is not very appropriate if we, for example, think of the airspace restrictions put in place for Russia,\" Haavisto said.Which food has the worst environmental impact?Just days after Russia started its attack on Ukraine \u2013 which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\" \u2013 in February, Finland joined a string of Western countries in closing their airspace to Russian planes, making it difficult for Russians to travel to Europe.Currently, Finland processes around 1,000 Russian visa applications a day, Haavisto said. Since Russia lifted its COVID-19 travel restrictions on July 15, the number of Russian tourists heading to Finland has steadily increased, spurring discontent.While the numbers are still well below pre-pandemic levels, there were more than 230,000 border crossings in July \u2013 up from the 125,000 in June.Haavisto said tourist visas from Russia will be limited by restricting the allotted opening hours for tourism visa applications, as an outright ban based on nationality is not possible.\"This means that other types of visas \u2013 visits to relatives, family contacts, work, study \u2013 will be given preference and more time,\" the minister explained.Finland and the Baltics would together propose that the European Union (EU) discontinues a visa facilitation agreement with the Russian federation that makes it easier for Russians to travel to and within the bloc, Haavisto said.Some EU leaders, such as Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin and her Estonian counterpart Kaja Kallas, have called for an EU-wide visa ban, which German Chancellor Olaf Scholz contested on Monday, saying Russians should be able to flee their home country if they disagree with the regime.\"It's not right that Russian citizens can enter Europe, the Schengen area, be tourists... while Russia is killing people in Ukraine. It's wrong,\" Marin said on Monday.Finland was looking into creating a national humanitarian visa, which could be granted to Russians that needed to flee or visit Europe for purposes such as journalism or advocacy, Haavisto added.\"This could make the situation in certain circumstances much easier for journalists or NGO workers,\" Haavisto said.According to EU rules, a tourist must apply for a visa from the country they intend to visit but can enter the border-check-free Schengen area from any point and travel around it for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.Finland has imposed the same sanctions on Moscow as the rest of the EU, such as forbidding the import and export of some industrial goods and freezing some assets in EU banks.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu attend the Army-2022 forum in the Moscow region. /Maxim Shemetov/Reuters\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu attend the Army-2022 forum in the Moscow region. /Maxim Shemetov/Reuters\n\n\u2022 Russia's president Vladimir Putin has accused Washington of seeking to prolong the Ukraine conflict while fueling tensions elsewhere in the world, including Taiwan island, calling top U.S. Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit a \"brazen demonstration of disrespect for the sovereignty of other countries.\" READ MORE BELOW\u2022 Russia has \"no need\" to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, its defense minister has said, adding that media speculation about Moscow's plans to deploy nuclear or chemical weapons in the conflict was \"absolute lies.\"\u2022 Two people have been injured in an explosion at an ammunition depot in Crimea, the second such event to hit the peninsula in under two weeks.

Germany is reopening 10 shuttered coal-fired power stations. /Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters\n\nThe Staudinger coal power plant outside Frankfurt. Germany is reopening 10 shuttered coal-fired power stations. /Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters\n\nAn EU import ban on Russian coal came into force on Wednesday \u2013 the latest in a suite of sanctions designed to rob Russia of lucrative fossil-fuel revenue.\u00a0Under the rules, EU countries will no longer be allowed to buy coal from Moscow. It comes as much of Europe is already facing the possibility of energy shortages over the winter, after Russia cut back natural gas supplies to key export pipelines, including Nord Stream 1 which connects Russia to Northern Germany.\u00a0Cities across Germany are working to cut back energy use, in an attempt to preserve gas supplies for the winter. Many cities and towns have opted to switch off street lights and turn off hot water at public swimming pools.\u00a0However, government forecasters say savings won't be enough to stabilize the grid, especially over the winter. Germany has also fired up 10 coal power plants which had already been retired \u2013 burning lignite coal seen as a difficult but necessary measure to shore up electricity supplies.But as with gas, challenges around where to source coal persist \u2013 especially as the full force of the Russian ban is likely to be felt in coming months. Before the war in Ukraine, Germany got almost half its coal from Russia with the search now on for alternative sources from further abroad expected to put even more pressure on household bills.Professor Christian Schweiger, a political scientist at Chemnitz University of Technology, says the impact of rising electricity prices on households remains a major challenge for the Scholz Government.\u00a0\"The less well-off people in Germany are less likely to accept that they should face additional financial burden for a somewhat ethical foreign policy that they don't fully support,\" he said. \"It will be very difficult for the government to find full-hearted support amongst the German population for this.\"Germany will increase coal imports from further abroad to compensate for the loss of Russian supplies. Exports from the U.S., Australia and South Africa are expected to increase to help to power the freshly re-opened plants.\u00a0Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the situation underscores the need for the country to move faster towards cleaner sources of power that can be generated domestically.\u00a0\"We see how dependent we are from energy imports all over the world and in this case, especially from Russia,\" he told reporters while visiting a hydrogen plant in western Germany.\u00a0\"It's important to know that we in Germany have technical abilities that are realistic and produce economically functioning jobs and economic value, which can help free us from this dependency and defend our own sovereignty.\"The government maintains the households will have enough heating over the winter \u2013 and that if energy does need to be rationed, it will be heavy industry asked to power down.But shoring up supplies does come at a cost: bills are expected to rise across the board. Even with increased coal output, a new energy levy being proposed by the Scholz government is expected to cost the average four-person family around $1,200 extra per year.\n\nRussian oil pipeline company Transneft has re-started oil flows via the southern branch of the Druzhba oil pipeline, RIA news agency said on Wednesday, citing Igor Dyomin, an aide to Transneft's president.\"The pumps are working - they were turned on at 16:00 (1300 GMT), operating mode pressure is set to be achieved in 15 minutes,\" Dyomin said.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said Wednesday that its forces had destroyed a German-supplied Gepard anti-aircraft system used by Ukrainian forces in the Mykolaiv region.In its daily briefing, the ministry also said it had shot down three Ukrainian warplanes in the area, as well as seven HIMARS missiles in neighboring Kherson.The Ukrainian side has not responded to the claims.\n\nGraphics: EU's full ban on Russian coal comes into effect\n\nThe European Union's (EU) import ban on all forms of coal imports from Russia, which had been announced in April, came into effect on Wednesday after a transition period of 120 days. It was the block's first sanction imposed on Russian energy exports.\n\nCoal, also known as solid fossil fuel, includes hard coal, brown coal and other coal products. In EU, hard coal is the most import-dependent type, with a dependency rate reaching 57.4 percent in 2020, according to the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).\n\nMany EU members have stopped production of hard coal in recent years, but their consumption has decreased slower than their production, resulting in heavy dependency on imports. For instance, in France, Italy, Iceland, Germany and many other countries in Europe, over 90 percent of hard coal supply was from imports in 2020.Russia had been the largest supplier of solid fossil fuel imports to the EU in recent years. Almost half of the EU's coal imports came from Russia, and the block's coal imports from Russia reached 62,106 million tonnes in 2018.\n\nThe ban may benefit suppliers from the U.S., Australia, Poland, and Colombia that are likely to be called upon to increase exports to Europe.\n\nHowever, the EU was less dependent on the import of coal than natural gas and oil, with only 35.8 percent of coal supply from imports, compared with 83.6 percent of natural gas and 97 percent of oil, according to Eurostat.\n\nThe block is a net energy importing region, relying on imports for most of its energy consumption. The energy consumption data between 2011 and 2020 showed that the EU had a tremendous demand for oil and natural gas consumption, and less demand for coal consumption.\n\nIn June 2022, the EU\u00a0adopted the sixth package of sanctions prohibiting the purchase, import, or transfer of crude oil and certain petroleum products from Russia to the EU.Although the EU has issued import bans on two major energy products \u2013 coal and oil \u2013 the EU sanctions do not cover natural gas, a major source of imported energy from Russia. The EU's dependency on Russian energy imports is rigid.The EU's announcement of an import ban on Russian coal has added volatility to coal futures prices. The price of Rotterdam, a Europe-wide coal price benchmark, was $149.8 per 1,000 metric tons on February 21, days before the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out. As of Monday, API2 Rotterdam coal futures amounted to $320 per 1,000 metric tons for contracts with delivery.\n\nCoal is back: European countries turning back the clock as Russian gas supplies dwindle\n\nRussian shelling killed 13 people in Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region overnight, governor Valentyn Reznychenko said on Wednesday.\"It was a terrible night. Eleven people were killed,\" he wrote on the social media app, Telegram. \u00a0He added in a later post that two more people had died of their injuries overnight.More than 20 buildings were damaged in Marganets, he said, a city across the Dnipro River from the Russian-captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where there have been other reports of shelling.The attack damaged a power line, leaving several thousands without electricity, Reznychenko\u00a0said.\n\nBiden signs protocols on Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris (L) and Ambassador Mikko Hautala

security and stability not only of Europe and the United States but of the world,\" he said of their entry into the post World War II alliance.The U.S. Senate backed the expansion by an overwhelming 95-1 last week, a rare display of bipartisan unity in a bitterly divided Washington.Both Democratic and Republican Senators strongly approved membership for the two Nordic countries, describing them as important allies whose modern militaries already work closely with NATO.NATO's 30 allies signed the accession protocol for Sweden and Finland last month, allowing them to join the nuclear-armed alliance once all member states ratify the decision.The accession must be ratified by the parliaments of all 30 North Atlantic Treaty Organization members before Finland and Sweden can be protected by

treaty\n\nRussia has temporarily withdrawn its facilities from inspections under the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the country's foreign ministry said in a statement Monday.\"Russia officially informed the United States that our country was temporarily withdrawing its facilities subject to inspections under this treaty from inspection activities,\" the ministry said.Moscow said it was forced to suspend inspections \"as a result of Washington's persistent attempts to restart inspection activities\" under unfair conditions, which created advantages for the U.S. side while simultaneously making it impossible for Russia to carry out inspections in the United States.Anti-Russian restrictions imposed by Washington have disrupted air travel between Russia and the United States, making it impossible for Russian inspection teams to reach necessary destinations, the ministry said.The ministry said both sides must \"abandon counterproductive attempts aimed at artificially speeding up the resumption of inspection activities\" and focus on eliminating all existing problems in this area.It said the measures were temporary and would be canceled if all existing issues were eliminated.In 2010, Washington and Moscow signed the New START, which limits the number of deployed nuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems by both.The last remaining nuclear arms

We must not repeat the mistakes of history.

Lavrov told Blinken that it was the U.S. sanctions that complicated the global food situation.The Russian Foreign Ministry also said that relations between Russia and the United States \"are in strong need of normalization.\"Blinken initiated the call with Lavrov, whom he had shunned as early as a few weeks ago, as he pressed Russia to accept an offer on swap of prisoners.\"We had a frank and direct conversation. I pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner,\" Blinken told reporters.The White House has faced growing public pressure to find a way home for Griner, an American basketball star jailed in Russia for the transport of cannabis oil, and Whelan, a former Marine jailed on espionage charges he denies. The U.S. proposal reportedly includes swapping the two Americans for convicted Russian arms smuggler Viktor Bout and would follow a similar prisoner exchange in April.Lavrov suggested to Blinken that the two sides return to quiet diplomacy on the issue.\"Regarding the possible exchange of imprisoned Russian and U.S. citizens, the Russian side strongly suggested a return to the practice of handling this in a professional way and using 'quiet diplomacy' rather than throwing out speculative information,\" said the statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry.A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the call lasted about 25 minutes and it was \"without polemics and was businesslike.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Black Sea port of Chornomorsk to see preparations for grain shipments, according to the president's office.Zelenskyy said his country is ready to start grain shipments from Black Sea ports and is awaiting a signal from the United Nations and T\u00fcrkiye to start the shipments.\n\nUkraine's military has denied carrying out an attack on a prison in Olenivka that Russia's Defense Ministry said killed 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war on Friday, and blamed it on Russian forces.\"The armed forces of the Russian Federation carried out targeted artillery shelling of a correctional institution in the settlement of Olenivka, Donetsk Oblast, where Ukrainian prisoners were also held,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said in a statement.\n\nGermany will deliver 16 BIBER bridge-layer tanks to Ukrainian forces, the country's Defense Ministry said on Friday.\"The BIBER will enable Ukrainian troops to cross waters or obstacles in combat,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"The delivery of the first six systems will take place this year, starting in autumn.

The drop comes less than a week after the pipeline restarted following a scheduled 10-day maintenance period.\n\nTurkey formally opened a joint coordination center for Ukrainian grain exports under a UN-backed deal aimed at resuming shipments for the first time since Russia's February offensive in Ukraine. /Ozan Kose/AFP\n\nTurkey formally opened a joint coordination center for Ukrainian grain exports under a UN-backed deal aimed at resuming shipments for the first time since Russia's February offensive in Ukraine. /Ozan Kose/AFP\n\n\u2022 Ukraine said it had restarted operations at its blockaded Black Sea ports as it moved closer to resuming grain exports with the opening of a coordination center to oversee a UN-backed deal. Turkiye formally opened a joint coordination center for Ukrainian grain exports aimed at resuming shipments for the first time since the start of the conflict. Finding enough seafarers willing to sail ships stuck inside Ukraine's ports is set to pose a major challenge to the proposed grains corridor.\u2022 Russian energy giant Gazprom drastically cut gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline to about 20 percent of its capacity, German authorities said.

The situation could worsen dramatically if Moscow cuts off gas exports, and once the European Union imposes a ban on Russian oil delivered by sea starting next year.\n\nA joint coordination center for Ukrainian grain exports officially opened in a ceremony in T\u00fcrkiye's Istanbul on Wednesday.The center will be staffed by civilian and military officials from Russia and Ukraine and delegates from T\u00fcrkiye and the United Nations.

It looks like the first grains will be loaded this week and its export from Ukraine will take place,\" the Turkish official, who requested anonymity, was quoted by Reuters on Wednesday.\u00a0But Rudenko said that the deal to unblock Ukrainian grain exports on the Black Sea could collapse if obstacles to Russia's agricultural exports are not promptly removed.On July 22, Russia and Ukraine signed a deal brokered by Ankara and the United Nations to reopen grain and fertilizer exports.\n\nMissile strike on hotel in east Ukraine kills at least 1\n\nAt least one person was killed in a Russian strike on a Ukrainian hotel in the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk region\u00a0on Wednesday, local authorities said.\"According to preliminary information, there are dead and wounded, a rescue operation is underway,\" Donetsk\u00a0Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote on Facebook.

July 21, 2022. /CFP\n\nThe European Union (EU) countries on Tuesday reached a political agreement to voluntarily cut their natural gas demand by 15 percent this winter, according to a statement from the European Council.\"Member states agreed to reduce their gas demand by 15 percent compared to their average consumption in the past five years, between 1 August 2022 and 31 March 2023, with measures of their own choice,\" it said.The purpose is to \"make savings ahead of winter in order to prepare for possible disruptions of gas supplies from Russia,\" according to the statement, which could be made mandatory in case of a substantial risk of a severe gas shortage or an exceptionally high gas demand.Hungary was the only country that opposed the deal, two EU officials said.The European Council agreed to exempt numerous countries from a mandatory gas reduction order.Member states that are not connected to other member states' gas networks, such as Ireland and Malta, are exempted, as they would not be able to free up significant volumes of pipeline gas to the benefit of other member states.Member states whose electricity grids are not hooked up to the European electricity system, and are heavily reliant on gas for electricity production, are also exempted, in order to avoid the risk of an electricity supply crisis.Countries that meet an EU target for filling gas storage by August could face weaker targets \u2013 softening the cuts for roughly a dozen states, including Germany and Italy, based on current storage levels.They can also exempt the gas they use in critical industries, such as energy-intensive steelmaking, from the target.\u00a0In addition, those with a limited ability to export gas to other EU countries can request a lower target, provided they export what they can. That could include Spain, which does not rely on Russian gas, and has said cutting its own demand would not help other countries since it lacks infrastructure capacity to share spare fuel.\u00a0Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in February and the West protested with economic sanctions, 12 EU countries have faced halts to, or reductions in, Russian gas deliveries.On Monday, Russian energy giant Gazprom said it would limit supplies to the EU through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 20 percent of capacity.Although the EU has agreed to embargo oil and coal from Russia starting later this year, it has refrained from sanctioning Russian natural gas because Germany, Italy and some other member states rely heavily on these imports.The disruptions in Russian energy trade with the EU are stoking inflation already at record levels in Europe and threatening to trigger a recession in the bloc just as it was recovering from a pandemic-induced slump.\n\nRelations between Russia and Greece are \"completely destroyed,\" and there is no cooperation or contact now, RIA reported on Tuesday, citing Russian Ambassador to Greece Andrey Maslov.\"Since the end of February, our bilateral relations have been completely destroyed, they no longer exist.

The European Union has accused Russia of resorting to energy blackmail, while the Kremlin says the gas disruption has been caused by maintenance issues and the effect of Western sanctions.Gazprom said it was halting the operation of another Siemens gas turbine at Nord Stream 1's Portovaya compressor station in accordance with the instructions of the relevant watchdog, taking into account the technical condition of the engine.It said throughput from 0400 GMT on Wednesday would therefore fall to 33 million cubic metres per day. That is just half of the current flows, already at just 40 percent of normal capacity.Why is it so hot in Europe?Politicians in Europe have repeatedly warned that Russia could cut off gas flows this winter, a step that would thrust Germany into recession and lead to soaring prices for consumers already grappling with higher prices for food and energy. Germany was forced last week to bail out Uniper, its biggest company importing gas from Russia.President Vladimir Putin warned the West this month that continued sanctions risked triggering catastrophic energy price rises for consumers around the world.\u00a0Gazprom resumed gas flows via Nord Stream 1 last week after a 10-day maintenance break, but only at 40 percent of the pipeline's capacity - a level Russia has said it was forced to lower volumes to in June because of the delayed return of a turbine being serviced in Canada.European politicians have challenged that explanation, with Germany saying the turbine in question was not meant to be used until September.\u00a0Gazprom said earlier on Monday it had received papers from Siemens Energy and Canada about the first turbine, but added that there were still problems.\"Gazprom has studied...the documents, but has to acknowledge that they do not remove the previously identified risks and raise additional questions,\" it said in a statement.\"Additionally, there are still open questions from Gazprom regarding the EU and UK sanctions, the resolution of which is important for the delivery of the engine to Russia and the urgent overhaul of other gas turbine engines for the Portovaya compressor station.\"The Kremlin said earlier that Moscow was not interested in a complete stoppage of Russian gas supplies to Europe, which is rushing to fill its underground storage before the winter season.It said Gazprom was not to blame for the storage risks, reiterating its line that Europeans are suffering the consequences of sanctions that they themselves imposed against Russia.Cover photo: Pipes at the landfall facilities of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline in Lubmin, Germany.. Reters/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said on Monday it is halting one more turbine at the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline for maintenance which would result in a reduction in gas flows.Gazprom said that due to the turbine stoppage, daily production capacity at the Russian Portovaya compressor station would be cut to 33 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas per day from 0400 GMT on July 27, down from its full capacity of more than 160 mcm per day.\n\nUkraine said on Monday it hoped the grain deal to ease global food shortages by resuming grain exports from the Black Sea region would start being implemented this week.A senior government official told a news conference he hoped the first grain shipment under the deal would be from the port of Chornomorsk on Wednesday.\n\nA repaired turbine will be installed at a compressor station of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline once it is returned from maintenance in Canada and natural gas will then be supplied in \"corresponding volumes,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.\"The turbine will be installed after all the formalities are complete... And the gas will be pumped in the corresponding volumes, the volumes which are technologically possible,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nThe Russia Defense Ministry said Russia struck a High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) ammo depot in Ukraine, RIA reported on Monday.\n\nThe Kremlin said on Monday that a Russian cruise missile strike against the port of Odesa in southern Ukraine would not affect the export of grain.In a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia had targeted military infrastructure in a missile strike on Saturday, just hours after Kyiv and Moscow had signed a landmark deal to restart crucial grain exports from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov looks on during a meeting with Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry at a mansion of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, July 24, 2022. /CFP\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov looks on during a meeting with Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry at a mansion of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, July 24, 2022. /CFP\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov offered reassurances to Egypt over Russian grain supplies\u00a0during a visit to Cairo on Sunday amid uncertainty over a deal to resume Ukrainian exports from the Black Sea.Egypt is one of the world's top wheat importers and last year bought about 80 percent of those imports from Russia and Ukraine. The months-long conflict between the two grain exporters disrupted shipments and sped up a rise in global commodity prices, delivering a financial shock to Egypt.Egypt has been torn between longstanding ties to Russia and its close relationship with Western powers that have sanctioned and sought to isolate Moscow. Western embassies had lobbied Egypt and the Arab League ahead of Lavrov's visit, which included talks with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and representatives of the Arab League.\"We reaffirmed the commitment of Russian grain exporters to meet all their commitments,\" Lavrov said in a press conference with Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry.\"We discussed specific parameters of cooperation in this area, agreed on further contacts between the relevant ministries, and we have a common understanding of the causes of the grain crisis.\"Since the start of Moscow's \"special military operation,\" tens of millions of tonnes of grain have been trapped in Ukrainian ports, worsening global supply chain bottlenecks.Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations signed a deal on Friday to restart Ukrainian wheat exports by sea, but a Russian strike on Odesa last week has put the implementation of the agreement in doubt.While Ukraine's efforts in restoring grain shipments to normal levels are ongoing, the Russian strike indicates that such efforts could be further hampered, making it take longer for the country to meet an expected target, Oleh Ustenko, an economic advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told Ukrainian television.Russia has blamed the halt in Black Sea trade on Western sanctions and Ukrainian mines, though, under Friday's deal, pilots would guide ships along safe channels. Lavrov said he hoped the UN would succeed in removing \"illegitimate restrictions\" on shipping.\"There are still 70 foreign vessels from 16 or 17 countries standing there as almost hostages, including, incidentally, one vessel blocked in Ukrainian ports because of the threat of mines, which is supposed to bring food to Egypt,\" he said.He later told the Arab League that any ships coming to pick up grain from Ukrainian ports would be inspected to make sure they were not carrying weapons.Russia has continued supplying Egypt with wheat since February, selling to both the government and the private sector.Lavrov is visiting Egypt at the start of a regional tour of African states.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi on Sunday reaffirmed his country's support for a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian conflict, urging Russia and Ukraine to engage in dialogue.He made the remarks at a meeting in Cairo with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\"President El-Sisi stressed the importance of prioritizing the language of dialogue and diplomatic solutions to the crisis,\" a statement by the Egyptian Presidency said.\"The President affirmed Egypt's support for all endeavors that would speed up settling the crisis politically in order to maintain international security and stability. The President also stressed Egypt's willingness to support this path through international contacts and movements with all active powers, within both the bilateral and multilateral frameworks.\"At the meeting, Lavrov delivered a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin, which touched on issues of bilateral cooperation and underscored the importance Russia attaches to solidifying bilateral relations with Egypt.The Egyptian Presidency pointed out that the letter also conveyed Putin's appreciation for Egypt's initiative to form a ministerial liaison committee within the framework of the League of Arab States in an effort to settle the Ukrainian crisis, and the visit to Moscow by the concerned foreign ministers.Sunday's meeting was also attended by Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, Russia's Ambassador in Cairo Georgy Borisenko, and Deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maxim Maximov.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin held a phone conversation with his Uzbek counterpart Shavkat Mirziyoyev on Sunday, Russia\u2019s RIA news agency reported citing the Kremlin.The two leaders have discussed international topics regarding preparations for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Council of Heads of State scheduled for autumn.\n\nRussian armed forces destroyed a Ukrainian warship and a warehouse of U.S.-supplied Harpoon missiles in the port of Odesa with high-precision missiles, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday, according to TASS news agency.\n\nLavrov calls on West to 'remove obstacles' to resolve food supply issues\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday said Moscow is not asking for a lift of sanctions, but the West must remove obstacles created by itself to resolve the issues of global food supplies, Sputnik news agency reported.Lavrov spoke at a joint press with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry in Cairo.Earlier in the day, Lavrov met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi during his visit to Egypt.\n\nRussia claims to have hit Ukrainian military boat in Odesa port\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Sunday that the Russian forces had hit a Ukrainian military boat in the port of Odesa in Ukraine with high-precision missiles.\"The Kalibr missiles destroyed the military infrastructure of the Odesa port,\" she posted on Telegram.The Ukrainian military had mentioned that Russian missiles hit the southern port on Saturday, threatening a deal signed just one day earlier to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports and ease global food shortages caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nUkraine conflict 5 months on, peace still nowhere in sight\n\nUkrainian soldiers in a truck on the Donbas frontline, Donetsk, July 23, 2022. /CFP\n\nUkrainian soldiers in a truck on the Donbas frontline, Donetsk, July 23, 2022. /CFP\n\nWith the conflict between Russia and Ukraine entering the fifth month, peace is still nowhere in sight, even though both sides demonstrated the willingness to work together by signing a grain export deal to soften a global food crisis.Besides the landmark deal signed earlier this week, no recent peace talks have been held between the two countries, with Moscow accusing Kyiv of having no \"desire to discuss anything in earnest\" and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy playing down the prospect while Russian troops still control Ukrainian territory.The second phase of Russia's \"special military operation,\" which saw the pivot of its focus from Kyiv to the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, has lasted for more than three months. Russian forces have made significant gains, including the complete capture of the Luhansk region, which, together with Donetsk, comprises Donbas. While Russia keeps pounding Donetsk with rocket shells, its land forces have struggled to gain ground in some parts of the region.\u00a0In what marks perhaps a new phase of the conflict, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Moscow's military \"tasks\" in Ukraine now went beyond Donbas and extended into Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south.\u00a0Ukraine, which vows to retake all lost territories, continues to receive Western support in its fight against Russia. The U.S. has provided $8.2 billion in security aid for Kyiv.\n\nThe Russian government has expanded the list of unfriendly countries and territories to include the islands of Guernsey and Man, which supported the sanctions against Russia, as well as the Bahamas, news agency RIA reported on Sunday, citing the government's press service.\n\nWho benefits from the Black Sea Initiative?\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu attends a signature ceremony of an initiative on the safe transportation of grain and foodstuffs from Ukrainian ports, Istanbul, July 22, 2022. /CFP\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu attends a signature ceremony of an initiative on the safe transportation of grain and foodstuffs from Ukrainian ports, Istanbul, July 22, 2022. /CFP\n\nEditor's note:\u00a0Nikola Mikovic is a freelance journalist based in Serbia. He covers mostly Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian foreign policy issues. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily those of CGTN.The United Nations-backed \"historic\" deal signed between Russia and Ukraine, would allow the export of millions of tons of grain from the Ukrainian Black Sea ports, could pave the way for a future ceasefire agreement between Moscow and Kyiv. But if things go wrong, the Black Sea Grain Agreement, also known as the Black Sea Initiative, signed in Istanbul on July 22, could lead to a further escalations.Weeks before Russian and Ukrainian representatives arrived in T\u00fcrkiye to sign the deal, it became apparent that Moscow was ready to participate in the unblocking of the Black Sea. Russian withdrawal from Snake Island on June 30 was a clear indication that the Kremlin does not aim to establish control over Ukraine's Odesa port any time soon, if at all.\u00a0 On July 11, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that \"it was time to act on a United Nations plan to set up a sea corridor for Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea.\" Now that the deal is signed, T\u00fcrkiye will boost its role as a mediator over the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. But will Moscow and Kyiv benefit from the Black Sea Grain Agreement?The deal will allow Ukraine to start exporting its wheat via the Black Sea ports of Odesa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny, and earn around $10 billion from grain sales. The Ukrainian economy can recover to a certain extent, which means the West can reduce the amount of money it is sending to Kyiv. That is why Washington welcomed the Black Sea Initiative, saying, \"the devil's in the details.\"Indeed, according to the document, \"the parties will not launch any attacks on merchant ships and other civil ships and port facilities involved in this Initiative.\" The deal also states that \"all activities in Ukrainian territorial waters are under the jurisdiction and responsibility of Ukraine.\" But what if Ukraine launches attacks on the Russian forces in Kherson \u2013 a port city that is presently under Russia's control \u2013 from Odesa? If Russia responds and strikes Odesa, the West will interpret it as a violation of the Black Sea Grain Agreement, and will impose new sanctions on Moscow.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu talk before a meeting to discuss a deal between Ukraine, Russia, T\u00fcrkiye and the UN to resume exports of grain from Ukraine through the Black Sea, Istanbul, July 22, 2022. /CFP\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu talk before a meeting to discuss a deal between Ukraine, Russia, T\u00fcrkiye and the UN to resume exports of grain from Ukraine through the Black Sea, Istanbul, July 22, 2022. /CFP\n\nMoreover, it is doubtful if Russia can control the Ukrainian ships on their way back to Odesa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny. It will be T\u00fcrkiye that will play the role of major inspector, but there is no guarantee that the NATO member can turn a blind eye and allow weapons smuggling to Ukraine. Thus, the agreement could help Ukraine get more weapons, this time via the Black Sea.On the other hand, according to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the deal will \"help avoid a food shortage catastrophe for millions worldwide.\" From a humanitarian aspect, the Black Sea Initiative could help vulnerable countries that are heavily important of the grain import from Ukraine and Russia. Politically, however, the deal means that the Kremlin has made yet another concession to the West by de facto giving up its plans to \u2013 as the Russian General Rustam Minnekaev emphasized in April \u2013 to create a land corridor to Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria. In other words, the Odesa region, as well as a significant portion of the Black Sea coast, will remain in Ukraine\u2019s hands for the foreseeable future.Nonetheless, Russia has gotten certain concessions from the West in return. Moscow and the UN have signed the Memorandum of Understanding on exports of agricultural products, which means that Russia can sell its food and fertilizers abroad for the next three years. Additionally, NATO member Lithuania has reportedly lifted a ban on the rain transit to Russia's semi-exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea. More importantly, Washington has announced that it does not plan to supply Kyiv with ATACMS surface-to-surface missile, with a range of 300 kilometers. Thus, it is entirely possible that the Black Sea Grain Agreement is part of a wider deal between the Kremlin and Washington.The coming days and months will show if and how the Black Sea Initiative will be implemented. If both sides stick to the deal, it will represent a de facto local ceasefire in the Odesa region of Ukraine. As such, it could usher in a positive impact for Kyiv, as well as for countries that are dependent on their grain imports, but it could prevent Russia from achieving it strategic goals in the Eastern European country.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of routinely violating agreements after Moscow's forces on Saturday bombed Odesa's port, a facility key to a grain export deal the warring parties signed a day earlier.In a Telegram post, Zelenskyy called the attack cynical and a blow to the political positions of Russia itself. Ukraine said on Saturday that two Russian missiles hit the area of Odesa's grain pumping station.Odesa Regional Governor Maksym Marchenko said that infrastructure is damaged and there are wounded, without disclosing an exact number.T\u00fcrkiye's Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said Russian officials told Ankara that Moscow had \"nothing to do\" with the Odesa strikes.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has arrived in the Egyptian capital of Cairo for a working visit, RIA reported on Saturday.Egypt is the first country of Lavrov's African tour, which will last until July 28. He will also travel to Ethiopia, Uganda and the Republic of the Congo.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting on Saturday with a U.S. House of Representatives delegation led by Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith.\"The head of the Ukrainian state noted the importance of this visit, which is a strong signal of support for Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" read a statement on the president's website.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's defense minister Akar said Russia denied involvement with the strike on Odesa port, Middle East Eye reported on Saturday.The minister also said that he tried to encourage both sides to maintain their deal reached on Friday to facilitate grain exports to do good for the world.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \"unequivocally condemns\" reported strikes on Saturday on Ukraine's Odesa port, a UN spokesperson said, adding that all parties in the Russia-Ukraine conflict had committed to a deal on Friday for the export of grains from Ukrainian ports.\"These products are desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe,\" UN spokesperson Farhan Haq mentioned in a statement. \"Full implementation by the Russian Federation, Ukraine and T\u00fcrkiye are imperative.\"\n\nUkraine says Russian missiles hit its Black Sea port of Odesa\n\nRussian missiles hit infrastructure in Ukraine's port of Odesa on Saturday, the Ukrainian military said.\u00a0\"The enemy attacked the Odessa sea port with Kalibr cruise missiles.

Russia earlier accused Ukraine of firing this week on the Zaporizhzhia plant, claiming a \"catastrophe\" was narrowly avoided \"by luck\".\u2022 Grain shipments disrupted by Moscow's offensive could resume from three Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea under the terms of a deal being discussed, a member of Kyiv's delegation for negotiations with Moscow said.\u2022 The U.S. promised to send four more HIMARS advanced rocket systems to Ukraine to help its forces fight Russia's advance in the eastern Donbas region. \"Ukraine needs the firepower and the ammunition to withstand this barrage and to strike back,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters.\u200b\u200b\u2022 Moscow will \"consider\" Budapest's request for more gas this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, as Russia seeks to develop its \"strategic\" ties with Hungary. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto made a previously unannounced visit to Moscow to discuss the purchase of an additional 700 million cubic meters of natural gas.\u2022 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that all difficulties with supply of Russian natural gas to Europe are caused by Western restrictions. Russia restored critical gas supplies to Europe through Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline after 10 days of maintenance, but uncertainty lingered whether the Kremlin would still trigger an energy crisis on the continent this winter. \"It's working,\" a Nord Stream spokesman said, without specifying the amount of gas being delivered.\u2022 Turkey said a new \"permanent committee\" would meet Finnish and Swedish officials in August to assess if the two nations are complying with Ankara's conditions to ratify their NATO membership bids.

It can take few hours to reach the nominated transport volumes,\" a spokesperson for the pipeline operator said.Klaus Mueller, president of Germany's network regulator, said the resumption of flows back to 40 percent capacity was not necessarily a sign tensions were easing. \"The political uncertainty and the 60 percent cut from mid-June unfortunately remain,\" he said on Twitter.To try to prevent a winter supply crunch, the European Commission has proposed a voluntary target for all EU states to cut gas use by 15 percent from August to March, which would allow Brussels to make the target mandatory in a supply emergency.\"Russia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon,\" the Commission's president Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday, adding that Europe had to prepare for the worst now.The Kremlin says Russia is a reliable energy supplier and blames Western sanctions for reduced flows.Its state-run energy agency Gazprom claims Western sanctions are responsible for the supply cut, which it says have delayed the return of a pipeline turbine that Siemens Energy ENR1n.DE was servicing in Canada.The mechanism is expected to be on its way back to Russia this week, but Gazprom says it has not received documentation to reinstall it, adding that the return of the turbine and maintenance of other gear was needed to keep the pipeline running safely.Russian President Vladimir Putin added to Europe's concerns about supplies via Nord Stream 1 on Wednesday by saying flows could be further reduced or stopped because the quality of serviced equipment could not be assured and saying other gear needed maintenance.In response to Moscow's warnings, European states have been chasing alternative supplies, including boosting the use of other fossil fuels to plug the gap amid a stretched global gas market.\n\nThe UK plans to send 50,000 artillery shells and hundreds more anti-tank weapons in coming weeks to Ukraine, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing British Secretary of Defense Ben Wallace.\n\nEU agrees on new sanctions against Russia\n\nThe European Council has agreed to impose new sanctions against Russia, including a partial gold embargo and the blacklisting of 55 individuals and entities, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter on Thursday.\n\nUkraine on Thursday cut the official exchange rate of the hryvnia to the U.S. dollar by 25 percent, according to the press service of the National Bank of Ukraine.\n\nAt least two people were killed and 19 others wounded in Russian shelling of Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, UNIAN news agency reported on Thursday, citing the governor of Kharkiv region.\n\nUK to prohibit coal, oil imports from Russia after gold\n\nThe UK government plans to prohibit the imports of oil and coal as well as related products from Russia after a prohibition on gold imports took effect on Thursday.\"The prohibition on the import of gold entered into force on 21 July, the prohibition on the import of coal will take effect on 10 August 2022 and the prohibition on the import of oil will take effect on 31 December 2022,\" the government said in a notice on its website.\n\nA view of pipe systems and shut-off devices at the gas receiving station of the Nord Stream 1 Baltic Sea pipeline and the transfer station of the Ostsee-Pipeline-Anbindungsleitung-Baltic Sea Pipeline Link (OPAL) long-distance gas pipeline in Lubmin, Germany, June 21, 2022. /CFP\n\nA view of pipe systems and shut-off devices at the gas receiving station of the Nord Stream 1 Baltic Sea pipeline and the transfer station of the Ostsee-Pipeline-Anbindungsleitung-Baltic Sea Pipeline Link (OPAL) long-distance gas pipeline in Lubmin, Germany, June 21, 2022. /CFP\n\nRussian gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline resumed on Thursday after 10 days of maintenance, according to Germany's dpa news agency.Gas is flowing again, and the gas transport level via Nord Stream 1 has resumed at the pre-maintenance level, around 40 percent of the pipeline's transport capacity, a spokesman for Nord Stream AG was quoted as saying.However, he added that the registered volumes could also change in the course of a day, and it would take some time before full transport capacity is reached.Meanwhile, Klaus Mueller, chief of the federal network agency Bundesnetzagentur, said on Wednesday evening that 30 percent of the maximum transport capacity was to flow through the pipeline.Nord Stream 1 transports 55 billion cubic meters of gas annually\u00a0from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea and has been offline since July 11.Requests for Russian natural gas flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline into Germany stood at 29,284,591 kilowatt hours per hour for the 6 to 7 a.m. CET slot, Reuters reported, citing data from the website of the operator, Nord Stream AG.The international consortium of five major companies was established in 2005 for the planning, construction and subsequent operation of two 1,224-kilometer natural gas pipelines through the Baltic Sea.A spokesperson for Austria's OMV said Gazprom signaled it would deliver around 50 percent of the agreed upon gas volumes on Thursday.On June 14, Russia reduced gas flows to 40 percent of capacity through the pipeline, citing the delay of a turbine being serviced in Canada. Canada has said it had issued a permit for the turbine's return, but it is not known when it will reach the Nord Stream.The West has accused Moscow of using its energy resources as a weapon. However, Russia insists it is a reliable supplier and dismisses the claims, saying that by supporting Ukraine, the West is waging economic warfare against Moscow.The European Union told member states on Wednesday to cut gas usage by 15 percent until March, warning that a complete shutdown of Russian gas supplies was \"likely.\"\n\nUkraine's First Lady requests more weapons from U.S. Congress\n\nThat was the message from Ukraine's first lady as she addressed the U.S. Congress on Wednesday.Her comments come as the Russian side says Western weapons systems being sent to Ukraine are forcing an expansion of military operations.\n\nFor more, check out our exclusive content on\u00a0CGTN Now\u00a0and subscribe to our weekly newsletter,\u00a0The China Report.\n\nPicture taken on Oct. 8, 2012 shows Nord Stream pipeline equipments before the opening ceremony of the North Stream second gas link in Portovaya bay, near the town of Vyborg in northwestern Russia. /Xinhua\n\nPicture taken on Oct. 8, 2012 shows Nord Stream pipeline equipments before the opening ceremony of the North Stream second gas link in Portovaya bay, near the town of Vyborg in northwestern Russia. /Xinhua\n\nGerman pipeline manager Gascade said it expected Russian gas deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 link to resume as planned after maintenance work wraps up on Thursday.\"We assume that, according to the current nominations (as of 3:00 p.m. on July 20), gas transport via Nord Stream will be resumed at the pre-maintenance level,\" Gascade said in a statement on Wednesday.The pipeline, which accounts for more than a third of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union, was halted for ten days of annual maintenance on July 11.\n\nEU diplomats agree to impose new sanctions on Russia\n\nEuropean Union (EU) diplomats on Wednesday reached an agreement to impose a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, the Permanent Representative of Poland to the European Union Andrzej Sados said after the meeting.The sanctions included an import ban on Russian gold, reinforcement on technology export controls, as well as targeting additional individuals and entities, a diplomat who spoke under condition of anonymity told Reuters, adding that sanctions would take effect after completing short formal procedures.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a phone conversation with President of the European Council Charles Michel, the Ukrainian president's office said on Wednesday.Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine needs more modern heavy weapons after they discussed the situation at the front in Ukraine.

In the past few weeks it has ramped up missile strikes on cities across Ukraine.\n\nThe European Commission on Wednesday proposed a voluntary target for the EU countries to cut their gas usage by 15 percent, which could be made legally binding if Russia cuts off gas supplies to Europe.The aim is to cut gas usage by 15 percent from August to March 2023, compared with the average consumption in the same period during the 2016 to 2021 period. The commission could make the target mandatory if it declares there is a substantial risk of severe gas shortage in the EU.However, the proposal needs approval from a reinforced majority of EU countries. Diplomats from EU states are set to discuss it on Friday, with the aim of approving it at a meeting of EU countries' energy ministers on July 26.A full cut-off of Russian gas supplies to Europe, combined with a cold winter, could reduce average EU gross domestic product by up to 1.5 percent if countries do not prepare in advance, the Commission added.\n\nGermany says Russia using absent

a key pipeline.\"I would like to stress that according to our information, this is an excuse by the Russian side,\" a German economy ministry spokesperson told reporters when asked about the reduced flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.Meanwhile, Russian energy giant Gazprom maintains that it has not received official documents from Siemens to allow the turbine\u2019s delivery for Nord Stream 1, and it understood that the turbine\u2019s return guarantee and overhaul of other engines directly affected the pipeline's operation.\n\nLavrov laments Ukraine being kept from negotiations\n\nUkraine

(GAZP.MM) signed a $40 billion primary deal for energy, according to Iran's oil ministry's news agency Shana.\"The contact with Khamenei is very important,\" Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, told reporters in Moscow. \"A trusting dialogue has developed between them on the most important issues on the bilateral and international agenda.\"In Tehran, Putin will also hold a face-to-face meeting with President of T\u00fcrkiye, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to discuss a deal aimed at allowing the resumption of Ukraine's Black Sea grain exports.High on the agenda in Tuesday's trilateral talks that will also include T\u00fcrkiye will be efforts to reduce violence in Syria, where Erdogan has threatened to launch more military operations to extend 30-km deep \"safe zones\" along the border. Moscow and Tehran both oppose any such action by Ankara.\"Maintaining the territorial integrity of Syria is very important, and any military attack in northern Syria will definitely harm T\u00fcrkiye, Syria and the entire region and benefit terrorists,\" Khamenei told Erdogan, Iran's state TV reported.\n\nAhead of Putin's arrival, Mohsen Khojasteh-Mehr, CEO of the National Iranian Oil Company, and Vitaly Markelov, deputy chairman of the Management Committee of Russia's Gazprom, signed a $40 billion investment in Iran's petroleum industry, Shana reported.The development of Iran's Kish and North Pars gas fields, as well as six oilfields, boosting pressure in the South Pars Gas Field, completion of LNG projects, swap of gas and petroleum products and construction of gas transfer pipelines, are among the most important highlights of the memorandum, according to the report.Khojasteh-Mehr also said the substantial Russian investment in Iran's oil industry indicates the two countries' commitment to ensuring sustainable energy supply.\n\nPro-Russia forces advancing from several directions toward Soledar: RIA\n\nThe Ukrainian soldiers were hardly holding back the offensive in the

Still, it was not enough, as new supplies were simply unavailable in the volumes required to substitute for missing deliveries from Russia.\u00a0He proposed five concrete actions for Europe to prepare for the coming winter. His suggestions included introducing auction platforms to incentivize EU industrial gas users to reduce demand, minimizing gas use in the power sector, enhancing coordination among gas and electricity operators across Europe, bringing down household electricity demand and harmonizing emergency planning.Russian gas delivery through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was suspended on July 11 for annual maintenance and is scheduled to conclude on Thursday.However, Russia's Gazprom told European customers it couldn't guarantee gas supplies because of \"extraordinary\" circumstances, Reuters reported on Monday, quoting a letter\u00a0from the state gas giant dated July 14.The letter added to fears in Europe that Russia may not restart the pipeline as scheduled in retaliation for sanctions imposed on Russia over its conflict with Ukraine, the report said.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution supporting Finland and Sweden joining NATO, with 18 Republicans voting \"no\", The Hill has reported.\n\nUkraine is constantly training new civilian volunteers to help fight the Russian invasion. Kyiv claims to have a total of one million personnel in its armed forces, with which it says it will\u00a0recapture the Russian-occupied south.CGTN accompanied a few dozen civilian volunteers to an ambush training session in a forest near Bucha. The men recently joined Ukraine's territorial defense which is operating together with the army against Russia.\"Today we exercised how to capture Russian soldiers and take by storm Russian military vehicles,\" explained soldier trainee Andriy Bat. The 34 year old realtor joined the forces just a few weeks ago.Surprising the Russians from behind in order to neutralize their commanders has proven effective so far. The training required for this, however, had to be cut short drastically.\"In general, normal education takes about two-three months,\" Colonel Andriy Dziuba told CGTN. \"But we don't have so much time that's why we had to reduce it so that the group will be ready in 4 weeks.\"Why is it so hot in Europe?Ukraine's government said that is able to deploy as many as 700,000 armed forces personnel with police, national guard and border guard on top - reaching a total of 1 million.But a significant number are already involved in defending Ukraine's remaining Donbas territory and could not be used in any counter-offensive.Nevertheless, Commander Taras Shapravsky is optimistic. \"All volunteers, those without experience and those with experience such as veterans, they will take their old uniforms and go to defend their community, their Oblast, their Motherland,\" he said. \"So if needed there will be more than a million.\"Despite the lack of official training, the Ukrainian military is certainly not lacking one thing: combat experience. And those who are just enlisting now will probably get it sooner rather than later.\n\nEuropean Union foreign ministers have approved another $500 million in military aid for Ukraine.\u00a0The country's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba expressed his gratitude for the support.\u00a0He had addressed his EU counterparts virtually on Monday to appeal for more financial assistance. Many officials in Kyiv have called for the West to go much further in helping Ukraine to defeat Russia.\u00a0Why is it so hot in Europe?Member states will vote this week on what has been dubbed the 'sixth-and-a-half' round of sanctions. Smaller than its\u00a0predecessors, it will mostly focus on closing loopholes and enforcing previous measures.\u00a0One addition is likely to be a ban on importing gold from Russia, a move that would align with steps taken by the G7 last month.\n\nThe package of sanctions is being debated amid rising inflation in Europe and significant uncertainty about Russian energy supplies.Most of the EU remains committed to toughening sanctions, but voices of dissent are starting to grow.\u00a0The EU's foreign policy chief Josep\u00a0Borrell called the challenge from Russia \"existential\" and urged unity.\u00a0\"European societies cannot afford fatigue,\"\u00a0he said on Monday. \"European societies and EU member states have to continue standing behind decisions they have taken. They have to keep putting pressure on Russia.\"\n\nBorrell also expressed optimism that a deal will be reached soon on unblocking Ukraine's grain exports. Over 20 million tonnes of grain are stuck in the country because the conflict has prevented deliveries by sea.\u00a0Turkey and the United Nations are leading the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine for shipments to resume for the first time since February.\u00a0A 'basic and technical' agreement was reached last week but a final one will take more time.\u00a0The EU will also clarify its own measures on food exports this week.\u00a0Agricultural deliveries from Russia are not sanctioned, but some traders have been reluctant to engage with Russian ports linked to sanctioned companies.\u00a0European officials say clarity will ensure that badly-needed supplies can reach the developing world. They insist that Russia's actions and not Western sanctions are creating uncertainty in global food supply.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye threatens to freeze Finland, Sweden's NATO bids if promises not kept\n\nT\u00fcrkiye would freeze Finland and Sweden's NATO membership bids if the Nordic countries do not keep promises on counter-terrorism made last month, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday.\n\nMinistry of Internal Affairs of the \"Luhansk People's Republic\" (LPR) \u00a0announced the capture of Ukraine's Seversk in Donetsk, RIA reported on Monday.There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side yet.\n\nRussian gas export monopoly Gazprom has declared force majeure on gas supplies to Europe to at least one major customer starting June 14, according to the letter seen by Reuters.The letter said Gazprom could not fulfill its supply obligations owing to \"extraordinary\" circumstances outside its control.\n\n\u2022 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sacked the head of Ukraine's domestic security service (SBU) and the head state prosecutor, citing hundreds of cases of alleged treason and collaboration with Russia.

As expected, U.S. President Joe Biden's trip to Saudi Arabia failed to yield any pledge from the top Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\u00a0producer to boost oil supply.The next meeting of OPEC and allies, including Russia, together called OPEC+, on August 3, will be closely watched as their existing output pact expires in September.Global markets are focused this week on the resumption of Russian gas flows to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which is scheduled to end maintenance on July 21. Governments, markets and companies fear the shutdown may be extended because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\"Brent crude will find support at the end of the week if Russia does not turn the gas back on to Germany after Nord Stream 1 maintenance,\" OANDA's senior analyst Jeffrey Halley said.Loss of that gas would hit Germany, the world's fourth-largest economy, hard and heighten the threat of a recession.\n\nRussia and Iran would not use the U.S. dollar in bilateral transactions in the future, the Kremlin said Monday.\n\nThe State Emergency Service of Ukraine said on Monday that the city of Toretsk in the Donetsk region was shelled and a two-story building in which people were staying was destroyed.Rescuers recovered the bodies of five people, and one of the three people rescued from the rubble was confirmed dead in the hospital, it added.\n\nThe deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office on Monday said the prosecutor general and domestic security service head had been suspended pending investigations, not formally dismissed.Andriy Smirnov was clarifying the announcement that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had made on Sunday that fired Iryna Venediktova and Ivan Bakanov.\n\nS.

My thoughts are with Mr Urey's family and friends at this horrendous time,\" added the minister, who is in the running to become the UK's next leader.Non-governmental organizations describe Urey as a humanitarian who worked as an aid volunteer in Ukraine.Moscow-backed separatists insist Urey was a \"professional\" soldier and took part in conflicts in\u00a0Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine.Morozova, the breakaway region's ombudsperson, said that the Briton took part in fighting in Ukraine and also recruited and trained mercenaries before his capture in April.Urey, born in 1977, was a Type 1 diabetic and needed regular insulin doses, according to his mother Linda Urey, who had earlier said his family was \"extremely worried.\"Morozova said he suffered from a number of chronic diseases and was also \"in a depressed psychological state.\"\"Despite the severity of the alleged crime, Paul Urey was given appropriate medical assistance,\" she said. \"However, taking into account his diagnoses and stress, he died on July 10.\"\u00a0Morozova also accused the International Committee of the Red Cross of refusing to provide Urey with necessary medicine.According to humanitarian organization Presidium Network, Urey was a well-travelled humanitarian who worked for eight years in Afghanistan.\n\nRussian missiles struck Vinnytsia in central Ukraine, killing at least 23 people including three children, in what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \"an open act of terrorism.\"The charred remains of upturned cars surrounded by burnt debris were seen in images distributed by officials next to a business gutted by a fire with brown smoke billowing nearby.In his daily address to the nation, Zelenskyy confirmed the toll and said it was likely to rise, with dozens still missing and many hospitalized in critical condition.\u00a0\"No other state in the world poses such a terrorist threat as Russia,\" a somber Zelenskyy said. \"No other state in the world allows itself to destroy peaceful cities and ordinary human life with cruise missiles and rocket artillery on a daily basis.\"Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \"appalled\" by the attack, while the EU slammed it as an \"atrocity.\" Both called for accountability.And Zelenskyy led a moment of silence before urging European and International Criminal Court officials to open a \"special tribunal\" into Russia's offensive.\"I believe it is inevitable that International Criminal Court will bring accountability to those guilty of crimes under its jurisdiction: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide.\"\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said on Friday that its Kalibr high-precision sea-based missiles hit the building housing Ukrainian soldiers in the city of Vinnytsia on July 14, TASS reported.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier said that at least 23 people were killed after Russian missiles struck the city, calling the attack \"an open act of terrorism.\"\n\nThe mayor of the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, Alexander Senkevich, said on Friday that Russian forces had fired at educational institutions, wounding at least two people.In a post on Telegram, he said rescue work was underway after more than 10 powerful explosions had occurred in the city.Russia has not yet responded to the claim.\n\nEU seeks to reduce heating, cooling of buildings to save gas\n\nThe gas receiving compressor station of the Nord Stream 1 natural gas pipeline in Lubmin, Germany, July 11, 2022. /CFP\n\nThe gas receiving compressor station of the Nord Stream 1 natural gas pipeline in Lubmin, Germany, July 11, 2022. /CFP\n\nThe European Commission is expected next week to ask EU countries to reduce heating and cooling of public buildings and offices to cut demand for gas, AFP has reported, citing a document seen by the news agency.\u00a0In order to better withstand the drastic fall in Russian gas supplies, which could be cut off altogether, the commission is expected to urge governments across the 27-nation bloc to set limits on the amount of energy used by public buildings, offices, commercial properties and outdoor terraces.For optimal energy use, it will recommend the rules require that public buildings be heated to no more than 19 degrees Celsius and cooled by air conditioning units set no lower than 25 degrees Celsius.\"Energy saved during the summer is energy that can be used in winter,\" the commission points out in the document.Energy experts say lowering the thermostat by one degree could cut a building's heating bill by about 10 percent. Air conditioning units generally struggle and fail to cool a room below 20 degrees Celsius, so they waste energy trying.The recommendation is part of a series of measures Brussels is investigating to cut the EU's gas consumption by 25 to 60 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year.The EU imported around 140 bcm of gas by pipeline from Russia last year, according to the International Energy Agency.\"Acting now could reduce the impact of a sudden supply disruption by one third,\" says the document, which is due to be published on July 20 and could be modified in the interim.It calculates that 11 bcm of gas could be directly saved from reducing excessive heating and cooling, and between four and 40 bcm via reduced electricity demand. Another 10-11 bcm could be saved from use by industries, which have already slowed production due to soaring prices.The document urges EU governments, where this is \"technically feasible and enforceable,\" to introduce binding limits on heating and cooling in \"public buildings, offices, commercial buildings (in particular large buildings) ... and open spaces like outdoor terraces.\"\u00a0The commission says that during the \"gas winter\" \u2013 October to March \u2013 \"large savings can be achieved by deploying alternative heat sources for district heating, heat pumps in households,\" as well as energy saving campaigns urging the public to turn their thermostats down by 1 degree Celsius this winter.\"The role of public authorities in leading by example and as an important gas consumer \u00a0\u2013 30 percent of the energy consumption \u2013 is key in this regard,\" the document states.But such \"protected\" energy customers \u2013 under EU legislation that means households, district heating that cannot switch to other fuels and certain essential social services \u2013 represent just 37 percent of total EU gas consumption. And simulations show these customers would be the last to be seriously affected by large-scale Russian gas disruptions, the commission says.It is therefore concentrating most of its efforts on power stations and industry, which use huge amounts of gas.\"Abrupt cuts could damage specific branches of those industries which have little room to switch to other fuels \u2013 because gas is being used as feedstock for industrial processes,\" the commission warns.\"It would be significantly less costly to moderately reduce natural gas demand for a longer period of time, starting earlier, than having to drastically curtail demand suddenly and without proper preparation,\" it explains.By way of encouragement, Brussels urges EU governments to set up \"auction systems,\" perhaps involving several countries, to compensate industrial consumers who agree to reduce their gas consumption.If there is a total cut in Russian gas supply from July onwards, EU states might only be able to replenish 65 to 71 percent of their gas reserves before winter, the commission said, quoting forecasts by European gas transmission system operators (ENTSOG).The commission's energy saving proposals are due to be discussed by EU energy ministers at a meeting in Brussels on July 26.",

      "text": "JEDDAH:\u00a0Folk music traditions in Saudi Arabia are diverse and complex, combining distinctive tones, rhythms and melodies with poetry, percussion, and dances that have been passed down through generations.\n\nOver the centuries, poets and musicians have traversed the Arabian Peninsula and the wider Middle East, exchanging and combining modes of expression through song, music and dance.\n\nThe contemporary soundscape echoes these ancient traditions, expressed through popular rhythms and songs that emerged from classic literature, epics, and heroic poems, mirroring the history, values, norms, and consciousness of society.\n\nSince pre-Islamic times, singers and reciters have helped spread poems among tribes. This practice found its way to the courts of the caliphs, where celebrated singers set poems to melodies and performed for private audiences.\n\nWith time, the courts disappeared, but the practice remained.\n\nNearly all melodies from the region fall within the esthetic principles of the centuries-old maqam system, a hallmark of Middle Eastern music. It describes a series of modes or scales and a way of improvising and forming melodies within those modes.\n\nMaqam scales usually have seven notes that repeat at the octave, while a few extend beyond eight notes. Though there is no harmony, harmonic intervals can sometimes be heard for a moment or two in passing.\n\nWhile visiting the Hijaz in 1814, Swiss orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt documented the region\u2019s distinctive musical notation in his book, \u201cTravels in Arabia,\u201d where he described performances by women separated into two choirs, each featuring six, eight or 10 individuals. One group would begin singing and chanting, while the other repeated after them.\n\nIn the Hijaz, there is rich musical culture based on song traditions that have more complex melodies than elsewhere in the Kingdom, expressed using instruments such as the oud, qanun, nay (the flute), and more recently, the violin.\n\nFor centuries cities like Makkah and Madinah had a musical life that rivaled or even surpassed those of neighboring Arab cities, such as Baghdad and Cairo, where music at royal courts was plentiful.\n\nThe migratory lifestyle of the Bedouin discourages excess baggage, including musical instruments, so these communities tended to stick to simple rhythms, with the beat counted by clapping or striking together everyday implements that formed the basis of the music.\n\nDrums were and still are considered an orchestra in themselves, as most Saudi and Gulf folk music uses shallow frame drums held in the left hand and struck with the right in a unique multi-toned rhythm.\n\nAnother layer of percussive sound in Saudi music is clapping and dance, the latter of which falls into two categories. The first encompasses steps in unison, such as the dance of \u201cal-dahha\u201d in the north, and \u201cal-khatwa\u201d in the southwest.\n\nThe second is a freestyle dance, often performed solo or in pairs, by dancers twirling colorful bisht (cloaks), such as the \u201cmajroor\u201d in Taif and the \u201cyanbaawi\u201d and \u201cmezmar\u201d in the western region.\n\nBlending elegiac poetry with singing, drumming, and slow, majestic movements, the \u201cardah,\u201d an old war dance that later became one of peace and celebration, is now an iconic part of traditional Saudi Arabian culture.\n\nThe poems sung are patriotic, and their dignified, masculine, and proud movements tell a historical tale of bravery, resilience and continuity.\n\nOver in the Kingdom\u2019s Eastern Province, folk arts are derived from the region\u2019s rich traditions of pearl diving, seafaring, oasis agriculture, and long-distance trade. There are date-harvest songs in Al-Ahsa, and shepherding songs from the southwest and other regions.\n\nThese traditions did not appear in complete isolation, however. Trade caravans, pilgrimages, and the search for new pastures carried traditions across great distances, blending cultures and spreading influences.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the map of Saudi Arabia, you will find that it is surrounded on all sides by different musical and lyrical (traditions in) countries,\u201d Abdullah Thabit, a Saudi poet and writer, told Arab News.\n\n\u201cYou have Yemen from the south, Iraq and the Levant, Turkey from the north, Gulf countries from the east, and Egypt and Sudan from the west. Regions were influenced by their surrounding regions over centuries.\u201d\n\nIt is therefore not immediately clear to the untrained ear what constitutes a definitively Saudi Arabian musical style, distinct from its neighbors, but common across the Kingdom\u2019s provincial boundaries.\n\nThabit says the modern musical style that can be described as distinctly Saudi Arabian was developed by Tariq Abdel-Hakim, commander-in-chief of the Kingdom\u2019s Army Orchestra in the Saudi Army Band, and the maestro who composed the Saudi national anthem.\n\nThe contributions of Abdel-Hakim, who died in 2012 at the age of 92, were considered a turning point for music in the Kingdom, as he transferred Saudi music from the aural melody to written musical notation on sound scientific foundations.\n\n\u201cIt was his student, Omar Kadras, who tried to mesh between the rhythm and sounds of folklore, giving birth to a new sound in Saudi music,\u201d said Thabit.\n\n\u201cTalal Maddah, a pioneer in Saudi music known as The Earth\u2019s Voice, was the first to sing Al-Mkblahah, or long songs. Mohammed Abdo then contributed to popularizing the new form of music, but you will find that before this new and matured form of music, it was greats such as Hisham Al-Abdali, Hasan Jawah, Abdulrahman Muezzin Platin, who was also a muezzin at the mosque, and more who made it popular.\u201d\n\nIn the second half of the last century, the artistic movement expanded and witnessed the emergence of several composers, such as Siraj Omar, Kadars, and many singers, led by Maddah, Muhammad and Abu Bakr Salem, then Abdul Majeed Abdullah, Abadi Al-Jawhar, Rabeh Saqr, Rashid Al-Majed and others.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s voices also appeared with them, although they are unfortunately very limited, such as Ibtisam Lutfi, Etab, Sarah Qazzaz, and Toha, who were closer to popular singing,\u201d said Thabit.\n\nToday, Saudi music encompasses everything from jazz, hip-hop and rap to techno and rock \u2019n roll, with many of these genres incorporating aspects of folklore traditions, such as Majed Al-Eisa\u2019s songs \u201cLifestyle Samry,\u201d \u201cLehe\u201d and \u201cHawages.\u201d\n\nWhile these traditions are colorful and lively, Saudi youth are also drawn to foreign music genres. Jara, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s youngest big-name performing artists, made waves when her rap single \u201c966\u201d was released in 2020, while hip-hop artist Qusai continues to make his mark a decade after his first release.\n\n\u201cUsing sounds from the region is simply a way to celebrate my heritage which feeds into the concept of exporting our beautiful culture,\u201d Saud Al-Turki, a Khobar-based record producer, told Arab News.\n\n\u201cAs a producer, I never wanted to feel restricted in regards to the sounds that I could tap into. In my opinion, connecting with a global audience is more impactful. The beautiful thing about Saudi sounds is that you can hear the inspiration from different parts of the region depending (on) where you are geographically.\u201d\n\nBefore the Kingdom began opening up in 2016 and started to promote creative industries and youth participation, Al-Turki says experimenting with musical styles was not commonplace.\n\n\u201cBack then, there was no support from government entities and big corporations. On the contrary, they did not receive the same acceptance, respect and support that current artists are receiving,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, Saudi Arabia is embracing the diversity of world music and evolving tastes, while never losing sight of its heritage.\n\n\u201cWe should never forget where we come from,\u201d said Al-Turki. \u201cSaudi Arabia is historically diverse and there\u2019s nothing more beautiful than a diverse culture. We have different sounds in every region that deserve to be appreciated and showcased.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to highlight and pay homage.\u201d",

Local and international experts in the energy and industry sectors stressed the important role of partnerships between the private and public sectors in Saudi Arabia, especially in terms of innovation, in achieving the Kingdom\u2019s sustainability goals.\n\nAl-Zamil said the 12 sectors targeted for expansion are aerospace, automotive, maritime, renewables, chemicals, machinery and equipment, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food processing, building materials, mining industries, and military industries.\n\n\u201cModern technology, innovation and digitization is creating disruptive transformation in the future of doing business and investments,\u201d he told delegates.\n\n\u201cHence, when we looked at the Kingdom\u2019s potential we discovered that it has enormous untapped technical potential as well as a predominantly young population with a passion for, and understanding of, the technological revolution and how to keep up with the latest technologies.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources has therefore launched a \u201cFactories of the Future\u201d program, \u201cwhich will result in a dramatic shift in the manufacturing sector,\u201d Al-Zamil added.\n\n\u201cThe goal of today\u2019s industry and mineral resources ecosystem is to develop a technological and innovative manufacturing sector,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will significantly improve our national industry and create locally competitive products, as well as increase industrial enterprises\u2019 contribution to the national economy.\n\n\u201cIt will also take advantage of the Kingdom\u2019s unique geographical location, which allows it to connect regional and international markets. Furthermore, the Kingdom boasts cutting-edge industrial infrastructure in over 36 industrial cities across the country. The Kingdom\u2019s emphasis on industry is an inevitable choice, as evidenced by the leadership\u2019s support for this strategic sector.\u201d\n\nAl-Zamil highlighted the launch of Ceer, a Saudi electric vehicle company, by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a few days earlier.\n\n\u201cCeer will be an important addition that will significantly contribute to driving and enhancing the manufacturing sector in the region, being the first Saudi brand for electric vehicles in the Kingdom,\u201d he said.\n\nGeorge Oliver, the chairman of Johnson Controls, told Arab News: \u201cAs a global leader in smart and sustainable buildings, we are part of this world and we have the responsibility to help address some of the pressing issues the world is facing, such as climate change.\n\n\u201cAdvancing the national conversation of energy sustainability by having subject-matter experts, business leaders and policymakers talking about sustainable living and the need for more innovation in energy consumption is an important outcome of this event.\n\n\u201cAt Johnson Controls International we believe sustainable innovation is all about meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the needs of future generations. It requires all actors to actively incorporate climate change and carbon neutrality into their innovation processes.\u201d\n\nOliver said that buildings are currently responsible for nearly 40 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cSo, as a global leader in smart, healthy and sustainable buildings, Johnson Controls is committed to lead the fight against carbon emissions and climate change,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJohnson Controls is no stranger to the region generally or Saudi Arabia specifically. As part of its Vision 2030, the Saudi government has put plans in place to increase the country\u2019s manufacturing and local content footprint. This is where the objectives of the Saudi government and Johnson Controls converge.\n\n\u201cAs a global leader in building technologies, we would like to be part of the incredible economic transformation that is happening in Saudi Arabia. As Saudi Arabia is going through a massive economic transformation, where it intends to spend $7 trillion in 10 years, much of that relates to renewable energy and sustainable living.\u201d\n\nMohannad Al-Sheikh, the CEO of Johnson Controls Arabia, emphasized the importance of innovative solutions that \u201cenhance standards of efficiency and sustainability in buildings, with ambitious plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions in the Kingdom.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Kingdom plays a leading role in facing climate change and we, at Johnson Controls Arabia, are keen to support the visionary goals of the local environment by promoting sustainable living standards in the region.\u201d",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",

Fleeing the conflict, many attempted to cross the Mediterranean in unseaworthy boats, and if they were lucky, reached European shores.\n\nAmong the many asylum seekers who fled were Syrian sisters and swimmers Sara and Yusra Mardini, whose real-life story has been turned into a much-talked-about film, \u201cThe Swimmers,\u201d currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nDirected by Welsh Egyptian filmmaker Sally El-Hosaini, \u201cThe Swimmers\u201d follows teenagers Sara and Yusra (portrayed by Manal and Nathalie Issa respectively), who are skilled swimmers, thanks to the professional training of their father and coach (Ali Suliman).\n\nSara is the cool, rebellious and tough sister, who does not believe she will achieve big things in life. Yusra is soft, sensitive, but disciplined with her eyes on the prize. She wants to compete at the Rio Olympics in 2016. \u201cSwimming is where I belong,\u201d she says in one scene.\n\nInitially, their life in Damascus carries on, despite distant bombings, power cuts, and harassment from security officials. As the environment becomes increasingly dangerous, the Mardini family decides that Sara and Yusra should leave for Berlin with their DJ cousin, Nizar (Ahmed Malek), with the hope that the rest of the family would follow.\n\nThe journey is long, arduous and humiliating. They join other refugees, including children, departing from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos. They are packed onto a boat for the journey. But trouble arises where the engine dies in the midst of choppy waters.\n\nWith the boat sinking, the people begin throwing their possessions overboard. There is a heartbreaking moment when Yusra has to drop her medals into the water. Will she ever achieve her dream? The pivotal moment of the film happens with Sara and Yusra bravely jumping into the water and leading the boat and fellow passengers all the way to the island.\n\nWith a cast of new faces, the film is gripping, well-paced, and at times, quite intense. There are tearjerking moments of despair, as well as hope and kindness, found in the camaraderie of the refugees. Later they would receive similar help and support from Sven (Matthias Schweighofer), who trains Yusra for the Olympics at a swimming club in Berlin.\n\nVisually, the film features several powerful and memorable shots, taken from above and below, that emphasize the magnitude of the conditions which the sisters had to overcome.\n\nIf there is a film to watch before the year ends, \u201cThe Swimmers\u201d is it. It is a reminder of the determination of the human spirit, and that sometimes in life, with its twists and turns, achieving things may eventually occur, but in a way one could never imagine.",

We used to get pregnant women coming in all the time,\u201d Batoul, otherwise known as Halal Food Sydney on social media, said in the video.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s spokeswoman confirmed with 7Lifestyle customers can \u201cadd a limited number of extra pickles to a burger, wrap or salad at no extra cost\u201d.\n\nBatoul - who goes to a halal McDonald\u2019s in Liverpool - claimed there was another reason behind why ice cream machines are always \u201cbroken\u201d.\n\n\u201cSometimes when we used to say the ice cream machine was broken, it actually wasn\u2019t... someone accidentally put shake mix into the ice cream mix,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen the restaurant she was working at was out of skim milk, she claimed she saw another employee use a full cream alternative.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re out of skim milk and we have to go get another bottle, I\u2019ve seen someone use full cream milk,\u201d she claimed.\n\nHer video has since been viewed more than 650,000 times, with many admitting they were surprised about the free pickles.\n\n\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m going to ask for pickles,\u201d one wrote.\n\nWhile another joked: \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have told me about the pickles because I\u2019m now on my way.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone has been lucky with the \u201cfree\u201d pickles, with some claiming they were charged for the topping.\n\n\u201cI always ask them for a cup of pickles and I get charge $2 - still worth it anyway,\u201d one wrote.\n\nWhile another added: \u201cPickles might be free where you live but definitely not in Sweden or Europe.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many weighed in on the ice cream machine and full cream milk.\n\nOne former employee saying: \u201cHalf the time on overnights when we said \u201cthe ice cream machine isn\u2019t working\u201d, it really means I just cleaned it and I\u2019m not making a mess for you.\u201d\n\nAnother customer said: \u201cYes, I\u2019m aware that full cream milk is used...

      "text": "A victim of the Manchester Arena bombing would likely have survived had it not been for the inadequate emergency response, an inquiry has found.\n\nJohn Atkinson's injuries were \"survivable\" but he did not receive the \"treatment and care he should have\", said Sir John Saunders, chairman of the Manchester Arena Inquiry.\n\nMr Atkinson, a 28-year-old healthcare worker, was one of 22 innocent people who lost their lives following the suicide bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017.\n\nA report examining the emergency response to the attack found that \"significant aspects... went wrong\" and \"the performance of the emergency services was far below the standard\" it should have been.\n\n\"Some of what went wrong had serious and, in the case of John Atkinson, fatal consequences for those directly affected by the explosion,\" Sir John said.\n\nThe inquiry has heard that firefighters did not arrive at Manchester Arena until two hours after the bombing; only one paramedic entered the blast scene in the first 40 minutes, and Greater Manchester Police (GMP) did not declare a major incident for more than two hours.\n\nThe father of the youngest victim - eight-year-old Saffie-Rose Roussos - described the emergency response as \"shameful\" and \"inadequate\", with some experts telling the inquiry she could have survived had the response been different.\n\nHowever Sir John concluded that \"there was only a remote possibility that she could have survived with different treatment and care\".\n\n\"On the evidence that I have accepted, what happened to Saffie-Rose Roussos represents a terrible burden of injury,\" he said.\n\n\"It is highly likely that her death was inevitable even if the most comprehensive and advanced medical treatment had been initiated immediately after injury.\"\n\nIn the second of three reports into the Manchester Arena bombing, Sir John found that 20 of the 22 people who died in the attack suffered injuries that were \"unsurvivable\".\n\nHowever in the case of Mr Atkinson, the retired High Court judge said that had the victim \"received the treatment and care he should have, it is likely that he would have survived\".\n\n\"It is likely that inadequacies in the emergency response prevented his survival,\" Sir John added.\n\nMr Atkinson, a fitness fanatic whose family described him as their \"heart and soul\", had received tickets to the Ariana Grande concert as a Christmas present and went with a friend.\n\nHe was standing just six metres away from Salman Abedi when the bomber detonated his device at about 10.30pm on 22 May 2017, causing severe injuries to Mr Atkinson's legs.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow emergency crews responded to arena bombing\n\nSecurity failings that led to Manchester attack\n\nThe inquiry heard Mr Atkinson, from Bury, Greater Manchester, lost a significant amount of blood as he laid in agony on the foyer floor for 47 minutes before he was carried downstairs by police on a makeshift stretcher to a casualty clearing area at Victoria station.\n\nMore than 20 minutes passed - as ambulances queued outside - before he went into cardiac arrest at 11.47pm and was finally rushed to Manchester Royal Infirmary at midnight, where he was pronounced dead about 25 minutes later.\n\nA member of the public, Ronald Blake, held an improvised tourniquet on Mr Atkinson's right leg for up to an hour before paramedics reached him.\n\nOnly three paramedics entered the area known as the City Room, where the bomb went off, on the night - two of them just a few minutes before Mr Atkinson was evacuated.\n\nHe was not triaged, assessed or assisted by North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) personnel during his time in the foyer.\n\n'John was totally failed at every stage'\n\nIn his report, Sir John said he accepted the conclusion of experts that Mr Atkinson \"would have survived if given prompt and expert medical treatment\".\n\nHe concluded that medical tourniquets should have been applied to Mr Atkinson's legs and dressings applied to his wounds earlier.\n\nThe inquiry chairman said \"responsibility for that failure\" rested with the arena's operator SMG and the management of Emergency Training UK, which was contracted to provide healthcare at the venue.\n\nHe added that more paramedics should have been in the City Room earlier and they would likely have \"identified the need for urgent treatment and evacuation\" of Mr Atkinson.\n\n\"That did not occur,\" Sir John said. \"Responsibility for that failure rests with NWAS.\n\n\"Such treatment would, I am satisfied, have enabled John Atkinson to arrive at hospital prior to having a cardiac arrest and would probably have saved his life.\"\n\nSir John also said that Mr Atkinson should have been moved from the City Room promptly and if firefighters had been at the scene at the time, the victim would have been \"prioritised for evacuation\".\n\nHe also pointed out that if more ambulances had been at the scene shortly after 11pm, Mr Atkinson would have received treatment and he would have been taken to hospital sooner.\n\n\"Either way, he would have reached hospital before having a cardiac arrest and is likely to have survived,\" Sir John said.\n\n\"John Atkinson would probably have survived had it not been for inadequacies in the emergency response.\"\n\nIn a statement following the report, Mr Atkinson's family said: \"It is now clear beyond any doubt that on the night of the bombing John was totally failed at every stage.\n\n\"It is crystal clear that due to those failings, John died from injuries that he could and should have survived.\n\n\"He was left, dying, without his dignity, on the floor when it should have been obvious to medics that he needed to get straight to hospital.\"\n\nReferring to evidence heard during the inquiry that Mr Atkinson told a police officer: \"I'm gonna die,\" while he was lying on the floor, his family said: \"John must have known that he was dying and the pain that causes us is too great to put into words. This should simply never have been allowed to happen.\"\n\nIn his report, Sir John said \"significant aspects of the emergency response on 22 May 2017 went wrong\" and \"this should not have happened\".\n\nThe inquiry chairman said he had \"no doubt that lives were saved by the emergency response\", but added: \"Looked at overall, and objectively, the performance of the emergency services was far below the standard it should have been.\"\n\nHe said GMP \"did not lead the response\" the way it should have; Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) \"failed to turn up at the scene at a time when they could provide the greatest assistance\"; and NWAS \"failed to send sufficient paramedics\" into the City Room and \"did not use available stretchers to remove casualties in a safe way\".\n\nThe inquiry heard that police officers, arena staff and members of the public were forced to carry injured people using advertising hoardings, crowd barriers and tables due to the lack of stretchers, which Sir John said was \"a painful and unsafe way of moving the injured\".\n\nHe added that \"one of the most emotional and upsetting parts of the inquiry\" was hearing of the \"despair\" of those injured, who could hear ambulance sirens outside but saw few paramedics arrive.\n\nAmong the failures identified in the report:\n\n\u2022 Inspector Dale Sexton, the force duty officer at GMP's headquarters, became \"overburdened\" and made a \"significant mistake\" in failing to declare a major incident in the early stages of the emergency response. GMP only declared a major incident close to 1am - two and a half hours after the bomb went off\n\n\u2022 After inaccurate reports of gunshots, Insp Sexton declared Operation Plato - the emergency response to an attack by a marauding terrorist with a gun - but failed to communicate this to other emergency services\n\n\u2022 GMFRS station manager Andrew Berry sent firefighters to Philips Park fire station, three miles away from the scene, meaning some firefighters were driving away from the incident and past ambulances travelling in the opposite direction\n\n\u2022 Inspector Benjamin Dawson, from British Transport Police (BTP), declared a major incident around 10 minutes after the attack but did not tell GMP or GMFRS\n\n\u2022 There was \"substantial confusion\" over the location of a rendezvous point for emergency services, with each service choosing their own\n\n\u2022 NWAS declared a major incident about 15 minutes after the attack but this was not shared with any other emergency service.\n\nSir John said \"there was the failure of anyone in a senior position in GMFRS to take a grip of the situation during the critical period of the response\".\n\nHe acknowledged he had \"criticised a large number of people\" who he considered had \"made mistakes on the night\", adding that \"some of those criticisms may seem harsh, particularly given the situation that those individuals were faced with\".\n\n\"They were trying to do their best,\" he added. \"I do understand the enormous pressures that they were acting under.\n\n\"They had to do many things in a short time and it may not be surprising that things went wrong. I am not unsympathetic to them.\n\n\"But I need to identify mistakes where they have been made because otherwise there is no prospect of preventing them in the future.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThe missed opportunities to stop Salman Abedi\n\nManchester Arena lives could have been saved - but warning was 'fobbed off'\n\nIn a joint news conference after the report, GMP, BTP, GMFRS and NWAS apologised for their response to the Manchester Arena bombing.\n\nGMP chief constable Stephen Watson said the force's \"failings were significant\" on the night of the attack.\n\n\"We failed to plan effectively and the execution of that which was planned was simply not good enough,\" he said.\n\n\"Our actions were substantially inadequate and fell short of what the public have every right to expect, and for this, I apologise unreservedly.\"\n\nAmong a series of recommendations, Sir John said that \"in the event that public funding cuts are in the future considered necessary by the government, the Home Office should consider whether some funding arrangement for police services different from that applied in the post-2010 period is necessary\".\n\nResponding to the report, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was committed to \"learn from the lessons\" of the inquiry.\n\n\"Nothing will ease the pain of the families of those killed during the cowardly terrorist attack at Manchester Arena,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"It is my solemn commitment to the victims, survivors and their loved ones that we will learn from the lessons of this inquiry.\"\n\nSir John's first report on security issues at the arena venue was issued last June and highlighted a string of \"missed opportunities\" to identify Abedi as a threat before he walked across the City Room foyer and detonated his shrapnel-laden device.\n\nThe third and final report will focus on the radicalisation of Abedi and what the intelligence services and counter-terrorism police knew, and if they could have prevented the attack. It will be published at a later date.",

      "text": "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the attacker was a known terrorist threat and under 24/7 surveillance by police. It was the surveillance team who shot him dead at the supermarket.\n\nMuslim leaders wanted to deradicalise a future terrorist. They say they weren\u2019t given a fighting chance. Jehan Casinader investigates.\n\nLast Friday afternoon, Imam Muhammed Shaakir received a phone call. There had been a stabbing at a New Lynn supermarket. Shoppers were injured, and the attacker \u2013 a religious fanatic \u2013 was dead.\n\nAs the imam of the Avondale Islamic Centre, Shaakir\u2019s attention immediately turned to the Muslim community, and the need to shield them from any backlash.\n\n\u201cI was grieving the fact that this had happened on New Zealand soil. But it didn\u2019t even cross my mind that I knew the person who had done this. Before long, I discovered the name of the attacker, and I was truly shocked.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* LynnMall attacker 'brainwashed' by neighbours, mother says\n\n* Auckland terror attacker was 'very difficult' inmate to manage, non-compliant with orders\n\n* Heartbreak and support from Muslim, Sri Lankan, P\u0101keh\u0101 and M\u0101ori communities after terror attack\n\nJust months earlier, Shaakir drove to the maximum-security Auckland Prison. After weaving through a labyrinth of guard posts and gates, he was led into a special unit for prisoners of \u201cextreme risk\u201d \u2013 a unit originally built to house the gunman behind the Christchurch terror attack.\n\nIn a secure meeting room, Shaakir sat face-to-face with Aathill Samsudeen, a 31-year-old obsessed with violent, terror-inspired content. From behind a solid pane of glass, Shaakir tried to make a connection.\n\n\u201cAlthough he didn\u2019t know me from a bar of soap, he was really excited to sit with me. He was very calm, and we had a good discussion. I tried to get inside his mind to understand how he had been radicalised, and how I could assist and rehabilitate him.\u201d\n\nShaakir wasn\u2019t the only Muslim leader who believed Samsudeen needed help to rewrite his radical beliefs. Three years earlier, Auckland barrister Aarif Rasheed tried to persuade authorities to do exactly that.\n\n\u201cThey had characterised Aathill as a terrorist sympathiser,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cHowever, he was the first to admit his lack of Islamic knowledge, and he was willing to learn. With the right support, we had the chance to get this guy on the right path.\u201d\n\nThe Government wanted to deport Samsudeen, or at the very least, keep him behind bars. When it discovered it could do neither, he was released in July \u2013 without being rehabilitated. Seven weeks later, he lay dead in a New Lynn supermarket, after wounding seven people.\n\nToday, Rasheed and Shaakir speak publicly for the first time about their efforts to rehabilitate Samsudeen, and the opportunities they believe were missed.\n\n\u201cFor years, the authorities had treated this man as a terrorist \u2013 labelling him a terrorist, and convincing him that he is a terrorist,\u201d says Rasheed.\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s not forget that he lived in New Zealand for a decade before committing the act that actually made him a terrorist. The question we have to ask is, \u2018Did we find a terrorist? Or did we create one?\u2019\u201d\n\nOver the course of a decade living in New Zealand, Aathill Samsudeen became radicalised before carrying out a knife attack in an Auckland supermarket.\n\nWhen Aathill Samsudeen reached out for help, one of the first people he grabbed hold of was Aarif Rasheed.\n\nThe Auckland defence lawyer received a call from Samsudeen out of the blue in late 2017. Samsudeen, a 28-year-old refugee with no criminal history in New Zealand, was being held in custody after sharing violent content on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWhen Aathill phoned me from prison, he wanted pastoral support from the Muslim community,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cThe most striking thing about his situation was just how isolated he was. He really needed human connection.\u201d\n\nAlongside his work as a barrister, Rasheed had created Just Community, an organisation providing cultural support within the criminal justice system. The group also helps to rehabilitate offenders with extremist ideology.\n\nSamsudeen\u2019s online history revealed his fixation on weapons and ISIS propaganda. He had posted comments expressing support for terror attacks in Europe, and alluding to martyrdom. Police found a large hunting knife under his mattress. They also suspected he was trying to travel to Syria to join ISIS.\n\nRasheed says Samsudeen had been exposed to online religious content that was \u201cunstructured, emotive, misguided and politically-motivated\u201d, making him ripe for radicalisation.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is isolated from a formal religious tradition \u2013 and confused about their identity \u2013 they\u2019re vulnerable. They can cherry-pick any beliefs that suit their political ideology. It leaves them with a very puritanical, extreme form of religion.\u201d\n\nBut was he a threat? Rasheed sought input from Dr Clarke Jones, a counter-terrorism expert at Australian National University. Jones concluded that although Samsudeen was clearly aggrieved by political and social issues, he was not motivated to use violence.\n\nWhen Samsudeen was released on bail, Rasheed took him to a Muslim library, and introduced him to Islamic scholars who could help to rehabilitate him.\n\nIn July 2018, Rasheed wrote to the High Court, proposing a formal rehabilitation plan for Samsudeen, focusing on Islamic education and social connection. He hoped the man would one day be able to \u201cfeel Kiwi\u201d \u2013 a goal he described in the report as \u201caspirational right now, but doable\u201d.\n\nThe plan was strong enough to persuade Justice Edwin Wylie. When he sentenced Samsudeen to community supervision, the judge ordered him to complete the rehab programme.\n\nBut it never began. Police had laid fresh charges against Samsudeen, including for possessing ISIS-inspired religious hymns. After just weeks in the community, he was back in custody, where he would stay for almost three years.\n\n\u201cOur deradicalisation programme, which was part of his original sentence, would have required him to go on a journey with us, and get some perspective on what he had done,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cThey could have monitored him in the community while we were doing this. But before we could even begin, he was put behind bars again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to convince someone that they\u2019re not under siege, when the state keeps putting them in prison. It allowed him to remain in his delusion that he was crusading against the state.\u201d\n\nSome experts believe labelling Samsudeen a terror risk may have impeded his chance of rehabilitation.\n\nSamsudeen arrived in New Zealand in 2011 on a student visa. By the following year, he was working full-time as a car groomer. He had an empty life, with few friends.\n\nHe applied for refugee status, explaining that he had faced physical and psychological trauma in his home country, Sri Lanka.\n\nA psychologist found Samsudeen to be \u201ca highly distressed and damaged young man\u201d, who was experiencing violent thoughts and social isolation. She advised the court to immediately refer Samsudeen to Refugees as Survivors (RASNZ), an organisation that could help him to receive treatment for post-traumatic stress and depression. RASNZ told Stuff it has no record of Samsudeen ever being referred to its service.\n\nIn 2015, a foreign intelligence agency contacted the New Zealand Police to alert them to Samsudeen\u2019s online activities. Sources familiar with the case have confirmed to Stuff that, from an early stage, he was flagged as a terror risk.\n\nVictoria University criminologist and terrorism researcher Sara Salman questions whether this terror profile masked the root causes of Samsudeen\u2019s behaviour.\n\n\u201cPeople who are radicalised online have usually experienced deep social alienation, and that is weaponised by terrorist groups. They aren\u2019t necessarily committed to the ideology of a group like ISIS \u2013 rather, the ideology gives them a sense of belonging and meaning.\n\n\u201cAfter the Christchurch terror attack, people were sharing the video all over the world, and even posting sympathetic comments. This kind of behaviour is deeply concerning, and it does require a response. But we must remember that sharing or even endorsing this kind of content does not automatically make someone a terrorist.\u201d\n\nSalman says when someone is identified as a risk, Western countries often begin an \u201cimmediate and punitive\u201d response. While she accepts the need to detain some people in order to protect the community, she says this can be counter-productive.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is drifting into radicalisation, we see the most benefit from an early approach that moves away from criminalisation and is more focused on reintegrating them into society, rather than stigmatising them. In this case, I wonder if labelling Samsudeen a terror risk actually impeded his chance of rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nAarif Rasheed, a lawyer who helps to rehabilitate extremists when they're released from prison.\n\nDuring his three years on remand, Samsudeen would ring Aarif Rasheed, asking for pastoral support. Sometimes, there would be months between calls. Other times, he would ring every few days. Rasheed says Samsudeen felt \u201cthere was no one in his corner\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim community has been trying to provide basic chaplaincy services to Muslim prisoners for over 15 years, and we have faced roadblocks at every turn. We have little access to any Muslim prisoner \u2013 let alone someone with Aathill\u2019s security classification. We can\u2019t just wander in and out of prison. We have to be invited.\u201d\n\nAlthough Rasheed\u2019s proposed rehab programme would have been difficult to deliver inside a prison, it could have been done. However, he says Corrections did not pursue this.\n\nIn a statement, Corrections says Samsudeen was a \u201cvery, very difficult person to manage\u201d. He was openly hostile and abusive towards staff, who tried hard to reduce his risk of violence. Samsudeen was \u201cnon-compliant\u201d and \u201cconsistently refused\u201d to engage.\n\nHowever, was Samsudeen managed in a culturally responsive way? Samantha Patel, a registered psychologist who has worked in prisons, says forthcoming Government reviews must ask deep questions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re told this man refused psychological assessment. But how was he offered it? Did he know the person who would interview him? Was he worried they would judge him? Given he comes from a collectivist culture, did they use a support person to help to get him on side? Did they make the request in the middle of Ramadan, while he was fasting?\n\n\u201cResearch tells us that the psychological tools we use are far less important than the relationship we have with the offender. If we focus on creating a non-judgemental relationship, we are more likely to see positive change.\u201d\n\nPatel previously worked for Corrections and prison operator Serco. Now, she helps organisations to identify bias, including in the justice sector.\n\n\u201cWhen someone fears they\u2019re being discriminated against, they will have less cognitive resources and less working memory, because of the anxiety and stress. They become hypervigilant, and that affects their behaviour.\n\n\u201cWas [Samsudeen] seen, heard and valued? Did we train the officers working with him to manage their own biases and respond in a culturally appropriate way? Did he have access to the Quran? Did he know which direction he could pray in? Did he have to share a cell with someone who was eating non-halal food? These are all factors that could affect someone\u2019s behaviour.\u201d\n\nImam Muhammed Shaakir at the Avondale Islamic Centre in Auckland.\n\nCorrections says it \u201cengaged with the local Muslim community\u201d, and asked an imam to visit Samsudeen in prison. That person was Imam Muhammed Shaakir. In December 2020, he spent a full hour with Samsudeen, and describes it as a calm, promising first meeting.\n\nBut Corrections never followed up with him \u2013 \u201cno conversation, no emails, no calls, nothing\u201d. Five months later, Corrections contacted Shaakir during Ramadan. Samsudeen had asked to see him. Despite having a full schedule of prayers and community activities, Shaakir went to the prison.\n\n\u201cThis time, I found [Samsudeen] to be a very different person. He was frustrated and agitated \u2013 not towards me, but towards the prison guards. He didn\u2019t deny that he was abusing them and spitting at them. He told me he was being provoked, and felt trapped.\u201d\n\nAgain, there was no follow-up from Corrections. In a statement last week, the agency said Samsudeen \u201cmet with the imam twice, however he didn\u2019t engage in a meaningful way\u201d. Shaakir flatly disputes this.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. From my point of view, he was excited and happy to have me there. In fact, he wanted me to spend more time with him. When our hour lapsed and I stood up to leave, he said, \u2018No, it\u2019s fine \u2013 you should stay\u2019.\u201d\n\nBy himself, Shaakir says he would have found it difficult to deradicalise Samsudeen, but a collective, strategic approach could have been successful.\n\n\u201cWe needed to wrap our hands around this brother and make him feel part of a family. You need time with a person to get them on your side and find common ground, before you start the process of education and deradicalisation.\n\n\u201cCorrections had three years to deal with this situation. What did they expect? That in just two visits, everything was hunky dory, and we can move on? It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nA few months ago, Aarif Rasheed received a phone call from Samsudeen. He had been given a surprising piece of news: the Government was preparing to release him, as it could not lawfully detain him any longer.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018These new people are coming to see me, and they\u2019re trying to do stuff for me\u2019. That was a little confusing for him. For so long, he had been made to feel like an enemy of the state. Then, all of a sudden, they were rushing to get him out.\u201d\n\nCorrections sought public housing for Samsudeen, but that was not available due to high demand. He agreed to be placed at a mosque in Glen Eden. The small centre does not have an imam, but its leaders agreed to accommodate him.\n\nCorrections says it did \u201cextensive planning\u201d with other agencies to protect the community from Samsudeen\u2019s \u201cviolent extremist ideology\u201d.\n\nBut key figures in the Muslim community \u2013 including Shaakir and Rasheed \u2013 were kept in the dark. The New Zealand Muslim Association, which had been consulted on earlier proposals for the release, says it was not told that Samsudeen was being let out.\n\n\u201cThey placed him at this little mosque, where the leaders are unpaid, part-time volunteers,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Here\u2019s a guy who is vulnerable and susceptible to agitation, who we\u2019ve just put through three years of social isolation. Thanks very much for taking him off our hands.\u2019\n\n\u201cAathill didn\u2019t just need to be with people of his own faith. He needed to be under the supervision of people who had the skills to manage him. The people at that mosque were never equipped for that. There are reports of him becoming distressed and unstable within weeks of being released.\u201d\n\nRasheed and Shaakir were never asked to be involved with Samsudeen\u2019s release. Both of them had already given their time and support for free.\n\n\u201cInstead of working with us, they did everything clandestinely, and farmed him off to a small mosque. Were they simply waiting for him to do something, so they could put the guy away again?\u201d\n\nRasheed says he was not told about Samsudeen\u2019s release.\n\nTwo Fridays ago, Rasheed received the news that Samsudeen had attacked people in a supermarket. Until that moment, he believed Samsudeen was still in prison.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, so he was out? That means they released him. That means they put him somewhere we didn\u2019t know.\u2019 I was reconstructing the whole chain of events that must have happened without my knowledge. On a raw, emotional level, I was just gutted.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern says state agencies did \u201ceverything within their power\u201d to deport or detain Samsudeen. Shaakir says the Government must examine whether it also used every avenue to rehabilitate Samsudeen.\n\n\u201cWe abhor, denounce and vehemently condemn his actions. But I am sad. We could have done more to assist in the rehabilitation of the brother, if we had been given more of an opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nGovernment-led reviews will reveal the full facts around the case. But the people interviewed for this story say those enquiries also need to address a much wider question: did our justice system feed the exact ideology that it was trying to suppress in Samsudeen? And in doing so, did it lead a traumatised, isolated young man even further down the road to becoming a terrorist?\n\n\u201cThe problem with the blunt label \u2018terrorist\u2019 is that it excludes everything else that was going on for this guy,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cIt excludes the longstanding mental health issues that were flagged not long after he arrived. It excludes his refugee background, and his own experience of terror.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying, \u2018Hurt people hurt people\u2019. Aathill is responsible for the hurt he caused last Friday. But as a country, will we take some of the responsibility for who he became?\u201d\n\n* A caption on a photograph in this story has been updated to state that Samsudeen is posing with an air rifle, not a firearm.",

      "text": "JEDDAH:\u00a0Moe Al-Ghunaymi creates astonishing live artwork using spray paint, varnish, and glitter on canvases, with his face covered and using transparent paint that serves as an exploration of identity.\n\n\u201cI paint with my mind, heart and body \u2026 in front of many people. This is a special and interesting challenge as I paint with a transparent material that is not visible to the eye. When I throw the glitter and the final painting appears (this) makes everyone surprised and impressed with the results,\u201d said Al-Ghunaymi, who is more popularly known as Medo.\n\nThe urban street artist and senior graphic designer added: \u201cI hide my face so that I am not limited by the opinion of the public, and therefore, I can be the most authentic version of myself. I believe they should not look at me, but instead look at my art, for my art is out of my true soul.\u201d\n\nOriginally from the land of the pyramids, Medo was raised in Makkah.\n\nHe discovered his talent as the art scene in the Kingdom gained traction, quickly gaining popularity for his impressive artworks created with unique mediums such as coffee, chocolate, and glow-in-the-dark paints.\n\nInspiration is important for all artists and the Jeddah-based creative derives his from the environment, and people\u2019s features and actions.\n\nHis artwork include portraits of royals and Western legends. However, his painting of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received a lot of praise.\n\n\u201cI always feel proud while painting a picture of Prince Mohammed bin Salman in front of people at events. I usually use the style of transparent painting with glue and then casting sparkles on it to become a luxurious and different piece of art.\u201d\n\nHe praised the crown prince as a \u201cgreat leadership figure\u201d committed to supporting talent in the Kingdom, and who makes him feel \u201cexcited and inspired.\u201d\n\nMedo said he seeks to surprise constantly.\n\n\u201c(With) my work as an art director, I work hard to translate my clients\u2019 ideas to their audience in the most creative way. It is like a fun game of chess where every time you have possibilities of making a move that can surprise your audience,\u201d he said.\n\nMedo is also known for creating the coolest NFTs in the country.\n\nHis take on digital and hand-painted artwork is that both have the same artistic results but differ from one artist to another depending on the tools used and the purpose of the creation.\n\n\u201cIn this age of technology, digital artwork has become bigger and bigger. Digital development and NFTs are the future of artists as they can turn their handmade artwork into digital work through photography and modern technology, thus creating as many immortal digital copies of a single work.\u201d\n\nMedo has participated in over 20 events including those organized by Benchmark KSA, Aramco, the Red Sea Film Festival, Luxury KSA, 360 live, and the Saudi Fine Arts Exhibition.\n\nHe has also worked with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority for many of their events including Saudi Seasons.\n\nHe is a brand ambassador for the Chinese Xtep Fashion Sport firm in Saudi Arabia and the founder of the fashion brand Art Section.\n\nHe sells his authentic art prints and paintings at Shop MEDO, and Apes Pop Art Club for NFTs on Instagram.\n\nEmirati singer Shamma Hamdan, Palestinian singer Mohammed Assaf and other prominent celebrities have bought Medo\u2019s artwork.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning for me and I look forward to depicting the culture and heritage of the Kingdom through my art. For all emerging and future artists, it is important to take care of your talent and practice art in any form. Art has no rules, art is for everyone,\u201d Medo said.",

My understanding was that he wanted one last standing but cricket is cruel like this,\u201d Hafeez was quoted as saying by Cricwick.\n\n\u201cMalik gave his best to Pakistan for about 21-22 years and maintaining your fitness standards for that long is absolutely remarkable.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, even when he had announced his retirement from ODI cricket, the farewell match was not given, realizing his services, the match should have been given. Our management has always been lacking when it comes to bidding them a farewell.\u201d\n\nThe Pakistan team are currently in action against New Zealand, with their two-Test series currently tied at 0-0 after the first match ended as a draw.\n\nThe second Test got underway on Monday in Karachi.\n\nPakistan Squad for New Zealand Test Series: Babar Azam (capt), Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Agha Salman, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Kamran Ghulam, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Naseem Shah, Nauman Ali, Sajid Khan, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Saud Shakeel, Shahnawaz Dahani, Shan Masood and Zahid Mahmood\n\nMORE PAKISTAN CRICKET NEWS: Not a T20 player, Shoaib Akhtar on Pakistan batsman who wants to look classic",

      "text": "The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber has \"taken the coward's way out\", families of his victims have said, as lawyers accepted he had been allowed to \"laugh in the face of the inquiry\" by fleeing the UK.\n\nSalman Abedi blew himself up at the Manchester Arena in May 2017, killing 22 people; and a second brother, Hashem, is serving life in prison for helping build the bomb.\n\nIsmail Abedi, their older brother, was due to give evidence on Thursday about the radicalisation of his brothers.\n\nHe had asked the inquiry to give an undertaking that he would not be prosecuted for anything he might tell the inquiry, but it was refused.\n\nOn 28 August this year, he was stopped by police at Manchester Airport.\n\nHe was interviewed and missed his flight but he returned to the airport the following day and was allowed to leave the country.\n\nPaul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, told the chairman he had received an email from Ismail's solicitor on Wednesday that \"made plain that Ismail Abedi's failure to attend was entirely intentional - in other words he will not come and answer your questions\".\n\nMr Greaney said the situation in which \"this important witness has been able to flee and then effectively laugh in the face of the inquiry is one that should never be permitted to occur again\".\n\nHe pledged: \"No one should think the story is over as far as Ismail Abedi is concerned.\"\n\nSir John Saunders, the chairman of the inquiry, said: \"That could be quite emotive language but it may well be true.\"\n\nShane Smith, from Slater and Gordon, speaking on behalf of 11 of the victims' families, said: \"On May 22 2017, our lives were torn apart and changed forever when Salman Abedi carried out his murderous attack.\n\n\"Since then, we have sought nothing but the truth: to understand what happened that night and why.\n\n\"Ismail Abedi was called to attend this inquiry today precisely in order to further that search for the truth.\n\n\"Others who were deeply traumatised by that night have had to relive those traumas by giving evidence to the inquiry and we have had to watch that evidence over many months and relive our own horror at what happened that night.\n\n\"Despite professing his innocence and claiming to disassociate himself from radical ideology and terrorism, he consciously chose not to attend today.\n\n\"A man who had genuinely rejected extremism would want to help the search for truth and would have been here today. Ismail Abedi is clearly not such a person but has taken the coward's way out.\"\n\nMr Smith said his \"absence speaks volumes\" and added: \"We are appalled to learn that Ismail Abedi left the country in August, having been stopped at the airport once before.\n\n\"We want to put on record our horror that Ismail Abedi could be allowed to leave the country in the face of an upcoming appearance at a statutory inquiry, which he had been ordered to attend.\n\n\"We are shocked that this can have been allowed to happen and we note the inquiry is seeking urgent clarification on this.\"\n\nMr Greaney said that on 22 July this year, the inquiry served a notice under Section 21 of the Inquiries Act 2005, requiring Ismail to give evidence, but \"nothing more was possible at this stage\".\n\nAny objection was required by 16 August but none was received.\n\nTim Suter, solicitor to the inquiry, wrote to Greater Manchester Police the next day, saying: \"It would be helpful if you could notify us as soon as possible if there is any information to suggest Ismail Abedi may not comply, for example by leaving the jurisdiction.\"\n\nIsmail was stopped at the airport on 28 August but was able to leave the UK the following day, with police not informing the inquiry until 31 August.\n\nSir John said he \"fully recognised\" the frustrations that must be felt by the families but added: \"I think that no one should rush to judgment and I am certainly not going to rush to judgment.\n\n\"We would like to know from Greater Manchester Police in detail what governs their action or lack of action.\n\n\"We all wanted him to be here to answer questions, although whether he would have been able to claim privilege against self-incrimination, we do not know.\n\n\"It may be a forlorn hope but the inquiry is not giving up all hope.\"\n\nCaroline Curry and Mark and Lisa Rutherford, whose children were killed in the attack, said on Thursday that they were \"incredibly frustrated and upset\" by Ismail's refusal to attend the inquiry.\n\nThey added: \"Learning that he was allowed to leave the country by Greater Manchester Police is very difficult to accept, especially with such an important witness, who is in a unique position to provide evidence that would hopefully lead to lessons being learnt about his brothers' radicalisation.\n\n\"Answers are urgently needed so that we can understand how this was allowed to happen. It is imperative that everything possible is done to prevent such events happening again at future inquiries, and it seems clear that changes to the law need to be considered.\"\n\nThe Home Office declined to comment when approached by Sky News.",

      "text": "Hollywood star Johnny Depp has been handed a restraining order after his wife, Amber Heard, appeared in court with a black eye and accused the Oscar-nominated star of assaulting her. Depp and Heard met on the sets of The Rum Diary (2011), when Depp was still in a relationship with French actress Vanessa Paradis, mother of his son Jack and daughter Lily-Rose. They married in a small, private ceremony in Los Angeles in February 2015.\n\nThis, however, is not the first time celebrities have lifted the shroud off their troubled marriages (and relationships). We look at a few other cases.\n\nRead: Johnny Depp physically abused me throughout marriage, says Amber\n\nSalman Khan, the erstwhile Bollywood brat, has a bad record when it comes to relationships. Many of his former partners \u2013 from Aishwarya Rai Bachchan to Katrina Kaif \u2013 have reportedly suffered physical abuse at his hands. When Salman was dating actor Somy Ali in the 90s, he once reportedly smashed a bottle of cola on her head in a fit of rage. Aishwarya admitted in an interview that Salman had hit her while they were going out. In 2001, her family filed a complaint about Salman coming to their house drunk and breaking window panes and furniture. He allegedly slapped Katrina Kaif on the sets of Yuvraaj in 2008, after he saw a newspaper photograph of her posing with Akshay Kumar at an IPL match. Sources said he slapped her earlier at a coffee shop too.\n\nBollywood actor Karisma Kapoor filed a case of dowry harassment against industrialist Sunjay Kapoor in February this year. What followed was a bitter battle for divorce and their children\u2019s custody.\n\nDimple Kapadia married superstar Rajesh Khann in 1973, just three months before Bobby \u2013 her debut film \u2013 was released. Dimple left Rajesh\u2019s house with their two daughters in April 1982. She later said in an interview: \u201cThe life and happiness in our house came to an end the day I and Rajesh got married.\u201d Rajesh used to allegedly beat Dimple up, and burn her with cigarettes.\n\nSanjay Khan and Zeenat Aman met on the sets of a film in 1980 and started dating. It was later reported that Khan assaulted Zeenat in full public view in the lobby of a Mumbai hotel.\n\nChris Brown was convicted of assaulting popstar Rihanna after a pre-Grammy\u2019s party in 2009. However, they got back together in early 2013.\n\nIn June 2014, model Rhea Pillai filed a domestic violence case against Leander \u2013 with whom she was in a live-in relationship. It was also said that Leander\u2019s father, Vece Paes, prevented Pillai and her daughter from entering their Carter Road residence. The two are still fighting for the custody of their daughter.\n\nBack in 1997, there were reports that Neetu called up a police station one night, telling them that her husband \u2013 Rishi Kapoor \u2013 assaulted her under the influence of alcohol. But when police reached their house, the couple denied making any such call. That, however, was enough to set the rumour mills running on the turmoil in their marriage. Rishi was even quoted as saying, \u201cWhich marriage doesn\u2019t have ups and downs?\u201d\n\nReality TV star Rahul Mahajan already had a history of abuse, with reports stating that he would beat his former wife Shweta. Dimpy, who married Mahajan on reality show Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge, later alleged that he assaulted and threatened her with a gun. Dimpy claimed that Mahajan punched and kicked her after she refused to show him an SMS she received on her phone. However, she later went back to him.\n\nFormer actor Yukta Mookhey filed for divorce in 2013, alleging that her husband \u2013 Prince Tuli \u2013 abused her physically and emotionally.\n\nSinger Adnan Sami had to divorce his wife, Sabah Galadari, after she filed a case under the Domestic Violence Act. Incidentally, this was the second time Sami married and divorced Sabah within the span of a decade.\n\nRati Agnihotri, known for films such as Ek Duje Ke Liye (1981) and Coolie (1983), recently filed a complaint against her husband of 29 years, Anil Virmani, accusing him of harassing and torturing her.\n\nTheir marriage is 20 years old now, but several problems seem to have marred their marital life over the last few years. Nandita filed a police complaint against Om Puri a few years ago, accusing him of hurling brass and bamboo artefacts at her. She said that he even pushed her against a wall, and threatened to kill her. The case is still in court.\n\nThe couple shared a tumultuous relationship for the longest time before getting divorced in 2007, when Shweta filed a domestic violence case against Raja. In 2011, the TV actor filed another domestic violence complaint against Raja when he barged into her house and assaulted her and a friend.",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",

However, Saudi Arabia\u00a0still lags\u00a0behind those targets, with just over $4 billion in inflows in the first half of this year.\n\nChaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, PIF is his chosen vehicle to drive efforts to diversify the economy and wean it off oil.\n\nLucid Group Inc, which is more than 60 percent owned by PIF, is building an electric vehicle assembly plant in Jeddah with an eventual capacity to manufacture 150,000 vehicles a year. The Saudi government signed a\u00a0deal\u00a0with Lucid to buy up to 100,000 of its cars over the next 10 years.\n\nA Lucid spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe kingdom is also making a push into mining and said in May that it would build an electric vehicle battery\u00a0metals plant.\n\n\"We will leverage Foxconn's technological expertise to support Ceer's vision of creating a range of iconic electric vehicles that are built around the themes of connectivity, infotainment and autonomy,\" Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said, according to PIF's statement.\n\n\"We want to make electric vehicles mainstream, and that is what Ceer is going to achieve in Saudi Arabia and the wider region,\" he added.\n\nPIF did not disclose funding details or say how much a Ceer plant would cost or where in the kingdom it would be built.

S. journalist?\n\nThat's the question many in the media, Wall Street and in international government circles after controversial comments made by Khosrowshahi in recent comments to \"Axios on HBO\" television show.\n\nIn the interview with the digital news platform, Khosrowshahi said the 2019 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi shows that \"the (Saudi) government said they made a mistake. It's a serious mistake, but we've made serious mistakes, too right?\"\n\n\"With self-driving, and we stopped driving and we're recovering from that mistake,\" he added. \"I think that people make mistakes, it doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they have taken it seriously.\"\n\nThe comments come after the recent one year anniversary of Khashoggi's murder by the Saudi regime on October 2, 2018. Khashoggi, a frequent critic of the Saudi government, was murdered and dismembered at the Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul, Turkey by a team of Saudi-based agents.\n\nKhashoggi was at the consulate on a civil matter, seeking official documentation of his recent divorce so he could remarry. His fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, a 36-year-old Turkish graduate degree student, was waiting outside for Khashoggi while he was in the consulate.\n\nAccording to Turkish authorities, Khashoggi was ambushed and murdered pre-emptively by a Saudi hit squad, under orders from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. After 18-days of denying any involvement in Khashoggi's murder, a Saudi government official stated on October 20, 2019 that the journalist was inadvertently killed in a chokehold by a Saudi agent who \"overstepped\" his orders to question Khashoggi.\n\nAt the same time, The Saudi regime also denied that Khashoggi was killed under the orders of Crown Prince bin Salman.\n\nOn November 15, 2018, Saudi Arabia arrested eleven country natives that the government said were directly responsible for the murder. In the indictment, the Saudi government called for the death penalty for five of the men charged in Khashoggi's murder.\n\nTwo days later, the U. S. Central Intelligence Agency stated that Khashoggi was killed under the orders of Crown Prince bin Salmon, who continues to deny the direct charges. In a later interview with \"60 Minutes\" the Crown Prince says that as the leader of Saudi Arabia, he bears \"full responsibility\" for Khashoggi's murder.\n\nAs the investigation continues into Khashoggi's death, Uber's Khosrowshahi is already backtracking on his comments to Axios on HBO.\n\nOne hour after his November 10 interview, Khashoggi phoned Axios to revise his comments. \"I said something in the moment that I do not believe,\" Khosrowshahi stated, according to Axios. \"When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused.\"\n\nOn November 11, Khosrowshahi followed up with a Twitter message expressing his \"regret\" for the language used in the Axios on HBO interview. \"There's no forgiving or forgetting what happened to Jamal Khashoggi & I was wrong to call it a \"mistake.\" As I told (Axios journalist) @danprimack after our interview, I said something in the moment I don't believe. Our investors have long known my views here & I'm sorry I wasn't as clear on Axios.\"\n\nIn the Axios interview, Khosrowshahi has compared the Khashoggi killing to a fatal accident with one of Uber's self-driving vehicles that occurred in Arizona in 2018. That \"mistake\" resulted in the death of a pedestrian who was misidentified by the Uber self-driving system as an unknown object.\n\nWhile cleared of any criminal negligence in that case, Uber has undertaken an internal review of its self-driving vehicle program, shut down its Arizona testing program, and temporarily halting its self-driving program.\n\nOne reason that Khosrowshahi's comments defending the Saudi regime were deemed to be so controversial is the ample financial backing the Saudi's have delivered to Uber.\n\nThe relevant data is in Uber's S-1 filings with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which shows that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has a 5.3% ownership stake in the drive sharing company.\n\nThere's more. The Saudi Public Investment Fund is also a big backer of Softbank's massive Vision Fund (it has over $100 billion in assets), which has a 16% stake in Uber ownership.\n\nAdditionally, Yasir bin Othman Al-Rumayyan, the director of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, is an Uber board member described by Khosrowshahi as \"very constructive\" and is a valuable business advisor resource that the Uber CEO \"greatly\" respects.\n\nThe bulk of Saudi Arabia's investment in Uber comes from a $3.5 billion direct investment in the company back in 2016, which resulted in the Saudi's holding 72.8 million shares of Uber, which recently went public. The investment was - and remains - the largest lump-sum investment from a foreign government in a U. S. startup.\n\nThat investment has gone sour for the Saudi's, as that original $3.5 billion stake in the company shed $1.1 billion in value as a result of Uber's generally declining share price through the end of October (the company's initial IPO stock price was $45 per share.)\n\nThose losses could continue in the fallout after Khosrowshahi's comments. As of midday on November 11, Uber's stock price has remained in the $27-per-share trading range, but technology investors may back off an already underperforming stock after its CEO's ill-advised defense of the Saudi's role in Khashoggi's murder.\n\nSaudi Arabia may be one of the largest investors in Uber, but it's certainly not the only big-name investor.\n\nBesides Saudi Arabia and SoftBank, Uber investors of note include Benchmark Capital Partners (an early eBay    (EBAY) - Get Free Report investor), Alphabet Inc.    (GOOGL) - Get Free Report (Google's parent company), and company co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick, who holds an estimated $5 billion investment in the drive sharing giant.\n\nKalanick had just sold about $500 million in Uber stock after the company's IPO lockup period closed. That move was more likely about Kalanick's financing of his latest venture, CloudKitchens, which also has attracted Saudi-based investment dollars.\n\nOtherwise, it's difficult to say how Uber investors will react to Khosrowshahi's comments to Axios, or if they're curbing their investments in the company.\n\nPrior to that interview, the Uber CEO has begun distancing himself from his Saudi investors, electing to avoid attending Saudi Arabia's annual investment conference in 2019, and also opted to miss this year's event, although Khosrowshahi has said this year's Saudi conference omission was due to a \"scheduling conflict.\"",

      "text": "With the NBA Abu Dhabi Games on Oct. 6 and 8 hosting the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks at the Etihad Arena on Yas Island, Arab News spoke to Saleh Mohamed Al-Geziry, director general of tourism at the Department of Culture and Tourism \u2013 Abu Dhabi, about sports tourism, the partnership with the American league, and how it will lead to promoting basketball in the UAE and the region.\n\nHere\u2019s what he had to say:\n\nOn the partnership between the NBA and Abu Dhabi:\n\nOur collaboration with the NBA is an exciting next step in our ambitious sports tourism strategy for the emirate, as we work to offer an unbeatable year-round calendar of fantastic sporting events. It\u2019s hard to overstate basketball\u2019s massive global appeal \u2014 the NBA is an incredibly popular league with millions of fans around the world, and viewership numbers that keep climbing year on year.\n\nSo, it was a natural choice to bring a sporting league of this magnitude to Abu Dhabi \u2014 it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to further raise our destination\u2019s global profile, as the eyes of the basketball world will be firmly focused on the UAE capital this October.\n\nThe NBA partnership is ideal for Abu Dhabi; we already have a track record of numerous successful tie-ups with high profile global IPs and the emirate is a destination that prides itself on offering unique and innovative experiences. Now, with the NBA Abu Dhabi Games this October, we can offer some of the world\u2019s biggest basketball superstars facing off in the region for the very first time.\n\nAnd of course, fans converging in Abu Dhabi for this first-in-the-region event will have a positive impact on airlines, hotels, attractions, restaurants, and shopping malls while creating a great atmosphere.\n\nOn the massive response from basketball fans to the inaugural NBA Abu Dhabi Games:\n\nThe response has been phenomenal \u2014 the inaugural NBA Abu Dhabi Games is a sold-out event, and the anticipation is palpable among NBA fans across the country and the region. None of this is a great surprise to us, as we knew the interest was there, but it is still so gratifying to see the fan engagement and excitement in the lead-up to this ground-breaking sporting event.\n\nThe great news for fans in the city is that the action is not just focused on the arena, this is an unmissable week-long celebration of sport, entertainment and culture featuring two historic NBA games, citywide activations, an interactive fanzone and special appearances by NBA legends.\n\nOn the different NBA events to take place over the coming years:\n\nAbu Dhabi and the NBA have entered into a multi-year strategic partnership, so we are exploring which activations and events make the most sense for the coming years.\n\nOne exciting offshoot of our collaboration that will definitely be taking place annually is the Junior NBA Abu Dhabi League, launched in February this year. It introduced the NBA and basketball to a whole new generation of 11- to 14-year-olds in Abu Dhabi, who also had the chance to meet and learn from seven-time NBA champion Robert Horry and Olympic gold medalist Clyde Drexler.\n\nOn the partnership between the NBA and DCT Abu Dhabi raising basketball\u2019s profile in the UAE:\n\nThe partnership between the NBA and DCT Abu Dhabi has already begun to contribute directly to the growth of basketball within the region. Take the Junior NBA Abu Dhabi League, for instance, where more than 450 boys and girls from 30 schools across the emirate participated in its first-ever edition this year \u2014 and I have no doubt that we will see participation numbers rising in the future.\n\nLooking to the wider region, this partnership also brings a huge range of activations to the GCC for the first time, including a series of NBA FIT clinics promoting health and wellness, an NBA 2K League Exhibition event at the annual Middle East Film & Comic Con, and interactive fan events featuring former and current NBA players. Such events will only grow interest in the sport of basketball and we look forward to seeing that development continue in the years ahead.\n\nOn how the NBA could develop local talent in the UAE and the region:\n\nHosting world-class sporting events ensures elite international players visit and inspire the local population, helping to grow interest and motivate young players to hone their talent and follow their dreams. Through its various high-profile events, Abu Dhabi has helped fuel the popularity of multiple sports throughout the region, including motorsports, golf, football, cricket, tennis, and swimming.\n\nBasketball is firmly on that list. An increasing number of Emirati teams are entering international competitions, and more than 220 players from the Middle East recently joined Basketball Without Borders, a program that develops talent outside of the USA. Commonly known as the NBA Academy, this year\u2019s cohort includes five players from the UAE.\n\nThe NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2022 is a first for the region, and undoubtedly a special and incredibly exciting time for basketball fans in the UAE and beyond. The sport of basketball is high-octane, with games speeding by at a breakneck pace, and those attending the games in October can expect non-stop action and thrills. I\u2019m sure the audience\u2019s energy will be electric as they cheer on their favorites.\n\nWhat will make that time extra special are the accompanying activities and interactive fan events, which will provide unmissable opportunities to meet some of the world\u2019s greatest basketball stars. Appearances by current top NBA players, as well as legends of the sport, will ensure that the NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2022 will be an unforgettable experience for basketball fans.\n\nOf course, we hope that fans venture beyond the on-court action and take the time to explore what the emirate has to offer. Visitors can ride the world\u2019s fastest roller coaster at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, soak up the sun on our stunning beaches, take in some culture at Louvre Abu Dhabi, or enjoy alfresco dining experiences at Yas Bay. No matter what they\u2019re looking for, there really is something for every visitor in Abu Dhabi.",

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this story appears in today\u2019s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN\u2019s three-times-a-week look inside the region\u2019s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nThe event that dominated the world\u2019s news agenda in 2022 was the Ukraine war and its far-reaching repercussions. Its impact was felt deeply in the Middle East, with the region\u2019s energy supplies, strategic waterways, and even weapons industries playing a key role in the war.\n\nLast year saw adversaries of the West strengthening ties with Middle Eastern states, sometimes at the West\u2019s expense. Gulf Arab states, keen to remain neutral in what they saw as a world order moving towards multipolarity, found themselves in an awkward position with their traditional allies in the West when asked to choose sides in the Ukraine war.\n\nThe war also \u2013 perhaps inadvertently \u2013 pushed Arab oil producers closer to Russia at the OPEC oil cartel, inviting the United States\u2019 wrath. And as China\u2019s relations with the US frayed, they continued to strengthen with Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut even as the Middle East\u2019s ties with the West fluctuated, its relevance remained intact and perhaps even grew. Europe increasingly looked to the region for energy security. Qatar, which hosted the 2022 World Cup, is set to become an even more significant gas supplier to Europe in the coming years.\n\nMeanwhile, two Middle Eastern neighbors, Iran and Turkey, supplied opposing sides of the war in Ukraine with drones that had a significant impact on the battlefield.\n\nThe war saw Ankara\u2019s international prominence grow, whether through its attempts to mediate between the warring parties or its grandstanding at NATO that stalled the alliance\u2019s expansion. All that gave a domestic boost to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as Turkey\u2019s economy reeled from an inflation-driven downturn.\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch out for in the Middle East in 2023:\n\nPresident Erdogan had set an ambitious set of goals for his nation in its centennial. But as the Turkish republic celebrates its hundredth year in 2023, Erdogan may find himself focused instead on trying to hold on to his seat.\n\nThe Turkish lira has been plummeting in value for four years and the cost of living has been skyrocketing as a result of Erdogan\u2019s unorthodox and widely criticized monetary policies that have shied away from raising interest rates to curb inflation.\n\nCoupled with years of governance fatigue and a new generation of voters who are looking for change, 2023 could potentially mark the decline of Erdogan\u2019s grip on power.\n\nElections, which are expected to take place in early summer, had dominated Turkey\u2019s domestic agenda for much of last year. For the first time in years, the opposition \u2013 at least for now \u2013 seems united around fielding a candidate that could unseat Erdogan. Last year saw the president suffer a major setback in opinion polls, with his approval rate slipping. The presidential system, engineered and implemented by Erdogan himself, requires a 50% plus 1 majority in elections \u2013 a tough proposition for the leader as the economy slows.\n\nOn the international front, the key NATO ally continues to struggle through its uneasy alliance with the US and Europe. The US\u2019 ongoing support for an armed Kurdish group in Syria that Turkey views as a national threat and a cold personal relationship between Erdogan and US President Joe Biden underscore the tense relationship.\n\nUnresolved disputes with Greece over sea borders in the Mediterranean as well as a war of words over a Greek military deployment in small Aegean islands close to Turkey continue to raise tensions with Europe. Whether or not the relationship with Europe can grow beyond cooperation over keeping migrants and refugees confined to Turkey will depend on finding common ground.\n\nWhen it comes to Ukraine, the Turkish position, regardless of who is victorious in the elections, will remain largely unchanged. The policy of \u201cpro-Ukrainian neutrality,\u201d as it is called locally, has paid off with a globally impactful grain deal and has kept the Turkish economy from taking further blows.\n\nIsrael has a new government, and although it\u2019s led by a familiar face \u2013 Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 it is made up of some of the most extreme right-wing figures to hold ministerial positions in Israeli history. Especially of note are Itamar Ben Gvir, national security minister in charge of Israeli police, and Bezalel Smotrich, finance minister who will have a say in the policies that affect the movement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Both are right-wing settler-lawyers turned politicians who were once considered the far fringe of Israeli politics.\n\nThese ministers are setting off alarm bells for many in the international community, including the United States, who are concerned their actions could further deteriorate the security situation on the ground. Ben Gvir and his ilk have openly talked about changing the status quo at Jerusalem\u2019s holiest site \u2013 known as Temple Mount to Jews and Haram al-Sharif to Muslims \u2013 where only Muslims are permitted to pray. But actions in the compound in the past have sparked an uprising and even a war.\n\nThen there\u2019s the West Bank, where Smotrich will have a big hand in determining policy. Last year was the deadliest for both Palestinians and Israelis in decades. Security cooperation between the Israeli military and the Palestinian security forces, which has long been seen by Israeli leaders as a key to keeping the West Bank calm, was already strained last year.\n\nNetanyahu has always run his governments as a one-man show, often de facto taking on such roles as that of the foreign minister. In recent interviews, he has repeatedly claimed that he and his Likud party will dictate policy. But allies, like major Jewish figures in the US, are concerned Netanyahu has built something he won\u2019t be able to fully control. One of the biggest questions is how the Biden administration will work with the Israeli government \u2013 and if it will even interact with the two controversial ministers. So far, the US is taking a wait-and-see approach, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying in December that the US will judge the Israeli government \u201cby the policies it pursues rather than individual personalities.\u201d\n\nWhen the OPEC+ cartel of oil-exporting nations including Saudi Arabia and Russia decided in October to cut production by two million barrels a day, it was seen by observers as a political gamble on the part of Riyadh, the group\u2019s de facto leader. The larger-than-usual cut was interpreted in the US as an attempt to raise oil prices ahead of midterm elections as the West tried to choke off the Russian oil revenues that were funding the war.\n\nBut just weeks after the cuts, oil prices dropped to pre-war levels amid concerns about a looming global recession and a slow Chinese exit from Covid-19 lockdowns. The drop prompted Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman to reiterate that the cartel\u2019s decision was right and not politically driven.\n\nThat price drop created confidence in the prince\u2019s guidance of the group, said Amena Bakr, Chief OPEC Correspondent at Energy Intelligence, an energy information company. \u201cI expect 2023 to be a year where OPEC+ remains very much united,\u201d she said, adding that a globally isolated Russia needs the alliance and is likely to go along with the group\u2019s decisions.\n\nAn uncertainty that may persist into 2023, however, is how the price caps imposed by Western nations on Russian oil in December may affect the market and in turn the price of global oil.\n\nAs a result, Russia has said that it may cut production by up to 700,000 barrels a day. But Energy Intelligence predicts that Russian crude and condensate production could drop by as much as 1.2 million barrels a day, said Bakr. That\u2019s over 1% of the global supply. If a gap emerges in the market, the cartel could even consider adding more barrels, she said.\n\nGulf states are also likely to become important providers of gas to Europe as it weans itself off Russian supplies. Qatar signed its first gas agreement with Germany in 2022 and another one with France, while neighboring UAE also signed gas deals with Germany and Austria. The country has also been touted by European officials as a future exporter of renewables to Europe.\n\nAs the international community was consumed by Iran\u2019s regional ambitions and the never-ending nuclear negotiation last year, an entire generation of repressed women at home shook the foundations of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAfter 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini died while in the custody of the nation\u2019s notorious morality police, the government found itself facing protesters in the streets of almost every major city in one of the strongest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution that brought it to power.\n\nThose protests, and Iran\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, further complicated Tehran\u2019s relations with the West, making an elusive nuclear agreement even more difficult to achieve. How the protests play out could dictate the course of the Islamic Republic\u2019s domestic, regional and foreign relations in 2023.\n\nThe momentum of the protests has slowed, and while the government actively works on a deterrence strategy, it is clear that a barrier of fear has been broken.\n\nBut if domestic woes were not enough for the Islamic Republic, it is now also dealing with shifting international geopolitics, including a burgeoning Chinese-Saudi partnership and a Russian ally that is now completely embroiled in a protracted war.\n\nThe continuation of crippling Western sanctions on Iran has pushed it further east to China, its biggest trade partner. In 2021, a 25-year strategic \u201ccooperation\u201d pact worth $400 billion of investment deals was signed between the two nations.  But as Saudi Arabia and Iran remain diplomatic enemies, and as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman warms up to Xi amid a Saudi quarrel with Biden over OPEC, the developing China-Saudi relationship, and its effect on the Islamic Republic, is one to watch in 2023.\n\nRegionally, Iran\u2019s archenemy, Benjamin Netanyahu, is back in power in Israel, with his attention firmly on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nWith an ailing Supreme Leader, Iran\u2019s leadership could be looking to firm up his successor, and as the elite Quds Force mourns the third anniversary of the loss of its leader Qassem Soleimani, Iraq\u2019s attempts to break away from Iran\u2019s influence also remains a challenge for Tehran.\n\nIranian police briefly detained several unidentified top-tier soccer players in a raid on a party on New Year\u2019s Eve where alcohol was served in violation of an Islamic ban, Reuters cited Iranian media as saying. The semi-official news agency Tasnim said several current players and former members of an unidentified top Tehran soccer club had been detained at the party. The YJC news agency said the gathering was a birthday party, and added that all those detained had been released except one person, who is not a soccer player.\n\nDubai scraps 30% tax on alcohol sales as regional competition heats up\n\nDubai has suspended a tax of 30% on alcohol and dropped a license fee previously needed to buy alcohol in the city, two major retailers said. The changes took effect on Sunday to run for a trial period of a year, according to local media.\n\nQatar has reintroduced a 48-hour negative PCR test requirement for travelers arriving in the Gulf state from China, Qatar\u2019s health ministry said Sunday. The changes will take effect from Tuesday.",

Now, she makes a living killing gods and enjoys it\".\n\nThat's until this slayer of gods finds one she cannot kill and must join forces with a disillusioned knight to defeat this indestructible deity.\n\n'The Making Of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece' by Tom Hanks\n\nSet in Hollywood, the Oscar-winning actor\u00a0offers an insider's take on\u00a0the efforts of making a star-studded superhero action film over the course of 80 years.\u00a0It follows Hanks\u2019 bestselling short story collection, 'Uncommon Type'.\n\nWhile\u00a0Harry and Meghan haven't exactly\u00a0held much back in their recent Netflix documentary, Prince Harry will have even more to say\u00a0in what is likely to be one of the biggest memoirs of 2023.\n\nPromising \"raw, unflinching honesty,\" Harry\u00a0tells his side of the story about life within the Royal Family and his\u00a0decision to give up royal duties and move to the US. But\u00a0just how many bridges it will burn back in Blighty remains to be seen.\n\n\"It was two months before the world premiere of Juno, and Elliot Page was in his first-ever queer bar\" and \"on the precipice of discovering himself as a queer and trans person\".\n\nWith Juno's massive success, Elliot became one of the world's most beloved actors and\u00a0in 2020 became\u00a0the first openly trans man to appear on the cover of Time magazine. 'Pageboy' reflects on gender, mental health, Hollywood and much more.\n\nA recently split couple attend an annual\u00a0gathering of their old group of friends. But they haven't told anyone they've broken up yet.\u00a0 Determined not to ruin the week, they try and fake it.\n\n'Phaedra' is one for fans of tales rewriting women back into the stories of Greek mythology such as Circe or The Women of Troy.

      "text": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Saudi Arabia for talks with King Salman on Sunday as part of a tour of oil-producing Gulf Arab states aimed at promoting peace amid a spike in tensions between the U. S. and Iran.\n\nJapan has a deep alliance with the United States, but it also has ties with Iran, which until 2017 supplied Japan with about 5% of its crude oil imports. Japan has sought to remain politically neutral as tensions in the Persian Gulf have escalated following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the U. S. from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers.\n\nSecurity in the Persian Gulf's waters and for Mideast oil supplies is a national security priority for Japan, which imports nearly 90% of its oil from the Middle East. Much of that is shipped from Arab Gulf states through the narrow Straight of Hormuz, which Iran partly controls.\n\nJapan plans to deploy naval forces, a destroyer and two patrol airplanes off the coasts of Yemen and Oman to help protect its energy supplies, while keeping away from directly patrolling the Strait of Hormuz as the U. S. does.\n\nAfter arriving late Saturday evening in Riyadh, Abe was given a ceremonial welcome and hosted for lunch by King Salman Sunday afternoon. Abe also met Sunday with Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman.\n\nSaudi media reported he was scheduled to meet the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This marks Abe's third visit to Saudi Arabia as prime minister.\n\nSaudi Arabia is Japan's top supplier of crude oil, accounting for about 39% of Japan's overall crude imports. Iran is unable to sell its oil internationally as it once did, due to U. S. sanctions by the Trump administration.\n\nOver the summer, Japanese energy supplies became a target of rising tensions when two cargo ships were mysteriously hit off the Gulf of Oman. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, although others that summer were blamed on Iran, which has denied involvement.\n\nThe attacks on Japanese-related cargo in June took place while Abe was in Iran  meeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani. He'd traveled to Tehran as an interlocutor for President Donald Trump to ease tensions.\n\nConcerns of a wider conflict have grown in recent days following a U. S. airstrike in Baghdad that killed Iran's powerful military commander, Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iran retaliated, striking two military bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed, though no casualties were reported. Amid the chaos and heightened threats, Iran acknowledged Saturday it had mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people aboard.\n\nAbe is scheduled to visit the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday and Oman on Wednesday, before departing back to Tokyo. In the UAE, he will meet with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and other leading Emirati figures. In Oman, Abe will hold talks with the country's new ruler, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, who was named on Saturday following the death of longtime ruler Sultan Qaboos.\n\nAbe is travelling with a delegation that includes ministers responsible for boosting trade and business ties.\n\nWhile in Saudi Arabia, he is scheduled to visit the desert region of Al-Ula, which the kingdom is touting as a tourism destination, and will reportedly met the Saudi crown prince there.\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Associated Press writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Cirkus, the last big budget Bollywood film of the year 2022, miserably failed to impress the audience. All the marketing and promotions, and the livewire energy of Ranveer Singh in a double role could not help the film from tanking at the box office. The year 2022 has been a phenomenally bad one for Bollywood with most of the films failing to get the cash registers ringing. However, with a gamut of releases up its sleeve, 2023 looks interesting for the industry. Going by the trends, it looks like it is going to be an action-packed year for the Hindi film industry in 2023.\n\nFrom Deepika Padukone and Ananya Pandey-starrer Gehraiyaan to the multi-starrer Jugjugg Jeeyo, a chauvinistic dysfunctional comedy, 2022 witnessed some of the most unappealing releases in this genre. Hopes are high for 2023 as there is a line of releases in romantic genre lined up for the year, including three big budget films. Here are some of the most anticipated films in the genre.\n\nRocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahan: With Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt romancing each other on the big screen, this film from the Dharma stable is touted to be one of the biggest blockbusters this year. The romantic drama also stars Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan, Shabana Azmi, Tota Roy Chowdhury and Churni Ganguly.\n\nTu Jhoothi Main Makkaar: A romantic comedy from Luv Ranjan, the movie seem to have the potential to revive Shraddha Kapoor's ailing Bollywood career. The actor is far from tasting box office blockbuster success despite having been around for 12 years.\n\nSatyaprem Ki Katha: Kartik Aaryan plays SatyaPrem and Kiara Advani plays his love interest Katha in this romantic drama, likely to be released on June 29. With Aaryan Bhool Bhulaiya 2 and Freddy, 2022 was a good year for Aaryan, and Satyaprem Ki Katha, directed by Sameer Vidwan, can become another feather in the actor's cap.\n\nWith seven films in this genre slated to release this year, there is a lot on offer for Bollywood action movie fans. However, the industry has seldom received praise for its treatment of action films and we can only hope that we get to see some \"real stuff\" that are on par with movies from other languages available on OTT platforms.\n\nPathaan: Siddharth Anand\u2019s upcoming action thriller Pathaan will mark the return of Shah Rukh Khan. The fourth installment in YRF\u2019s 'Spy Universe' also stars Deepika Padukone and John Abraham in the lead.\n\nJawan: Written and directed by Atlee, Jawan is an action thriller in which Shah Rukh Khan plays a double role. After Pathaan, this will be Khan's second film this year. Given that the superstar who ruled the 90s hasn't been able to deliver a single memorable hit recently, one can only hope that the tide turns in his favour. Jawan also stars Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi and Sanya Malhotra.\n\nAnimal: Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga\u2019s Animal will feature Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Parineeti Chopra, Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol in key roles. The gangster drama explores the dynamics between the characters, bringing out their \u2018animal\u2019 instincts. Animal is an important release for Ranbir Kapoor after the debacle that Shamshera was.\n\nTiger 3: After Ek Tha Tiger and Tiger Zinda Hai, Tiger and Zoya will be back in the third installment of the espionage franchise, featuring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in the lead. Given that Khan had no release last year, 2023 is crucial for him to reaffirm his 'Bhai-giri' via the Tiger franchise.\n\nKuttey: Last seen in Ek Villain Returns, which failed to come anywhere close to the original, Arjun Kapoor is in dire need of a film that can somehow save his fledgling career as an actor. Kuttey, directorial debut of Vishal Bharadwaj's son Aasmaan Bharadwaj, seems promising if the trailer is any indication of the things to come.\n\nMission Majnu: After failing to impress the audience with his 2021 release Shershaah and with Thank God that released in 2022, Sidharth Malhotra's next Mission Majnu will be a litmus test of his abilities as an actor who can deliver hits at the box office. Set in the 1970s, the movie is about an undercover Indian spy who takes on a deadly mission to expose a covert nuclear weapons program in the heart of Pakistan. Mission Majnu is set to premiere on January 20, 2023, in Netflix.\n\nKisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan: Salman Khan's Eid 2023 offer, Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan is directed by Farhad Samji. The film also stars Venkatesh and Pooja Hedge, and is backed by Salman\u2019s mother Salma Khan under the banner of Salman Khan Films. Khan was last seen in Antim: The Final Truth which tanked at the box office.\n\nWith Bollywood remakes of South Indian movies failing to recreate the impact of the originals, one can only hope that the upcoming remakes do justice to the originals.\n\nShehzada: Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon will reunite after Luka Chupi for this remake of Trivikram Srinivas\u2019s 2020 Telugu blockbuster Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo. Directed by Rohit Dhawan of Dishoom and Desi Boyz fame, the film also stars Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Ronit Roy and Sachin Khedekar.\n\nThe other releases include, Selfiee, Akshay Kumar's Hindi remake of the 2019 Malayalam-language comedy Driving License, featuring Prithviraj Sukumaran, and Bholaa, an official remake of Lokesh Kanagaraj\u2019s 2019 Kollywood hit Kaithi. Directed by Ajay Devgn, the film revolves around a prisoner who is returning home after ten years of prison life to meet his young daughter.\n\nIt is hard to get real life stories wrong. However, when it comes to Bollywood, one can never tell. Here is a list of upcoming Bollywood movies in the true stories genre.\n\nThe vaccine war: Directed by Vivek Agnihotri, who attained commercial success with The Kashmir Files, The vaccine war is being hailed as a tribute to the struggles and dedication of the medical fraternity and scientists during Covid in 2020 and the race to manufacture India's indigenous vaccine, Covishield.\n\nMaidaan: After a few interesting sports dramas/biopics released in the last two years, including Rashmi Rocket, Shabaash Mitthu, this year will see Maidan, a sports drama around football in India, directed by Amit Ravindernath Sharma. Based on the golden period of Indian football (1952-62), the star cast includes Priyamani, Rudranil Ghosh, Abhinay Raj Singh and Gajraj Rao.\n\nMrs Chatterjee Vs Norway: This is a true story of an immigrant Indian couple whose children were taken away by Norwegian welfare services in 2011. Ashima Chibber\u2019s film will star Rani Mukerji in the lead role of a mother who fights to get her children back.\n\nDunki: Shah Rukh Khan will come together with Rajkumar Hirani in the latter half of the year to deliver Dunki to the audience. The film revolves around the racket behind the illegal route known as Donkey Flight, used by Indians to immigrate to countries like Canada and USA. Hirani, the director of the Munnabhai films and 3 Idiots, is collaborating with Shah Rukh for the first time with Dunki.\n\nSwatantra Veer Savarkar: The movie traces the journey of freedom fighter and social reformer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, popularly known as Veer Savarkar.\n\nActor Randeep Hooda, in a recent interview to THE WEEK, said he read a lot about Savarkar and understood him fully before agreeing to play the character.

      "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday stayed criminal proceedings against senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid for allegedly trespassing into the Delhi Public School (DPS) Society office here.\n\nSenior advocate Siddharth Luthra, representing Khurshid, contended before a bench of Justices B. R. Gavai and Vikram Nath that he is open to mediation and it will be an ideal situation. Khurshid had moved the apex court against an order passed by the Delhi High Court in November 2019 in the incident connected with the dispute related to the leadership of the society.\n\nThe top court, in its order, said: \"Leave granted. It is clarified that the stay of the proceedings is only in the case pertaining to the present petition.\"\n\nThe bench also noted that Khurshid is a responsible and reputed person. Khurshid has challenged various Delhi High Court orders, which dismissed his plea for quashing the criminal proceedings against him and others in a case was registered for unauthorised entry into the society's office.\n\nIn December 2019, the apex court had issued notice on Khurshid's plea against the high court's order and asked the parties to explore the option of mediation and also stayed further proceedings in the case till then.\n\nAccording to police, in March 2015, the DPS Society had alleged that Khurshid, along with Sharda Nayak, trespassed into the society's office.\n\nThe high court in 2018, allowed Khurshid's petition to quash trial court order, passed in January 2018, summoning him as an accused for allegedly trespassing into an office of the DPS Society in south Delhi.",

      "text": "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Opener Devon Conway led New Zealand's early domination of Pakistan on day one of the second test in Karachi with a knock of 122, before the hosts struck back in the final session to limit their opponents to 309-6 at stumps on Monday.\n\nElecting to bat first, the visitors started strongly as Conway stitched together partnerships of 134 and 100 with Tom Latham and Kane Williamson respectively in front of a modest crowd at the National Stadium.\n\nConway, who scored a total of 110 runs in the first test, hit 16 boundaries and one six in his 191-ball knock to notch his fourth century in test cricket.\n\n\"It's been a good ride so far, I've only played a handful of test games so it's nice to get the opportunity to play and contribute for the team,\" Conway, whose century took him past 1,000 test runs, told reporters.\n\n\"It was nice batting out there with Tommy Latham and Kane, we managed to form some good partnerships.\"\n\nPakistan were finally able to stem New Zealand's flow in the evening as they took five wickets in the final session, with Agha Salman claiming the scalps of Conway, Henry Nicholls and Daryl Mitchell.\n\n\"I try to contribute as much as possible when I get the chance to bowl,\" Salman told reporters.\n\n\"I think as the test progresses, the wicket will begin to turn, because I feel it has more bite than it did in the first test.\"\n\nTom Blundell was on 30 unbeaten with Ish Sodhi at the close.\n\nThe two-match series is tied at 0-0 after the opening game, which was also played in Karachi, ended in a draw.\n\nFollowing the second test, the two sides will meet in a three-match one-day international series in Karachi.\n\nOff the pitch, Pakistan were given a boost as Shaheen Afridi, who has been out of action since suffering a knee injury during the Twenty20 World Cup final in Melbourne on Nov. 13, resumed his rehabilitation with the medical staff on Monday.\n\n\"While providing Shaheen top-notch care, this move will allow the medical staff to track his progression and pave way for his smooth return to action,\" the Pakistan Cricket Board said in a statement.\n\nThe statement added that fast bowler Haris Rauf's availability for the ODI series will be assessed by the medical staff in the coming week.",

      "text": "One year ago, even some sophisticated readers \u2014 and savvy editors \u2014 couldn\u2019t have identified Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a photo or found Luhansk and Donetsk on a map. It\u2019s doubtful they\u2019d have known what \u201cHIMARS\u201d or \u201cATACMS\u201d were, or that the largest nuclear reactor in Europe was in Zaporizhzhia, in southeastern Ukraine. We might have needed refreshers on the Budapest Agreement or NATO\u2019s Article 5.\n\nAnd one year ago, Grid\u2019s look at global hot spots for 2022 was focused more on Taiwan and North Korea than Russia and Ukraine.\n\nAnd yet as 2022 ended, Zelenskyy was everyone\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d and Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine was without question the year\u2019s most consequential global event. It looks certain to be the same in 2023 \u2014 for reasons that matter well beyond the battlefield.\n\n2023 will also be a year (like most in recent memory) when what happens in China influences events far from its own borders. As Grid\u2019s Lili Pike notes, China enters the new year in a state of rare tumult for President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party, given economic uncertainties and a messy unwinding of its \u201czero-covid\u201d policy.\n\nWhat happens in China and Ukraine will weigh heavily on the global economy, which starts 2023 with twin worries about inflation and recession, along with nightmarish \u201cdebt bomb\u201d crises roiling many nations of the Global South.\n\nAs 2023 begins, we are watching other hot spots, most notably the protest movements and regime response in Iran, missile tests (and \u2014 likely coming soon \u2014 a nuclear test) in North Korea, and the deepening crisis \u2014 for women and girls especially \u2014 in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll monitor global efforts to fight climate change, because \u2014 to put it bluntly \u2014 in the long term, no crisis matters more than the one that puts the planet at risk.\n\nBut we begin our look ahead with the item that rated barely a paragraph in last year\u2019s forecast. We begin with the war.\n\nThey are the most profound questions the world will face in 2023:\n\n* Will the war in Ukraine end?\n\n* If so, when and in what way?\n\n* And if not, what next for Ukraine and Russia?\n\nThe stunning reality is that as the new year begins, a Ukrainian victory is possible. A year ago, some of the world\u2019s sharpest military minds were warning that a Russian invasion would topple Ukraine\u2019s government in a matter of days or weeks. Against the world\u2019s largest army, and with a fickle friend in NATO, what chance did Zelenskyy and his country have?\n\nAnd yet here we are. The failings of the Russian military, resilience of the Ukrainian people and anything-but-fickle response of NATO were perhaps the greatest surprises on the global stage in 2022. Together, they have left Ukraine with a chance to win.\n\nThe year closed with Zelenskyy\u2019s triumphant visit to Washington (\u201cUkraine is alive and kicking!\u201d) and fresh pledges of tens of billions of dollars in U. S. military aid. New Year\u2019s resolutions for Zelenskyy and his commanders likely include counteroffensives in the east and south, and perhaps even a move to retake Crimea, which has been in Russian hands for more than eight years.\n\nBut obstacles remain \u2014 not least the fact that Zelenskyy\u2019s opponent appears dug in as ever. In one of his last addresses of 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed an all-in fight: \u201cDo they think we will just stand idly watching threats to Russia emerge? This is the problem: We simply have no room to retreat.\u201d\n\nAnd that means that beyond the can-Ukraine-win question, there are many others:\n\n* Will Russia make another move against Kyiv?\n\nIt seems unlikely, given the battlefield realities \u2014 but Ukrainian officials warned recently that Putin is planning an assault on the capital in the coming months. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s top commander, told the Economist that the Russians were mobilizing for a major spring offensive, including \u201canother go at Kyiv\u201d and strikes to interrupt NATO\u2019s flow of weaponry to the Ukrainians.\n\nSome analysts are skeptical, given the Russian military performance in 2022. And a new full-scale assault on Kyiv might harden even the softest among Ukraine\u2019s European supporters. But \u2014 like the initial invasion \u2014 the fact that a plan might be strategically flawed doesn\u2019t mean Putin won\u2019t try.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, a different question for 2023:\n\nIn the last days of 2022, both sides were talking about a deal.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba laid out a proposal for a February \u201cpeace summit,\u201d and on Christmas Day Putin told a Russia TV interviewer that \u201cwe are ready to negotiate with all the participants in this process about some acceptable outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that \u201cacceptable outcomes\u201d for Putin \u2014 recognition of the four regions he annexed in September and an official cementing of Russia\u2019s hold on Crimea \u2014 are non-starters for Ukraine. And Kuleba\u2019s February plan stipulates that Russia must first face a war-crimes tribunal. That\u2019s not happening any time soon.\n\nWhat this means is that one side will need to pummel the other badly enough to make negotiations attractive. It\u2019s not hard to imagine European support for deal-making \u2014 in Paris and Berlin especially \u2014 and Turkey, China or India may use their influence with Putin to move a peace process forward. But the year begins with a seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the two sides \u2014 and a strong appetite for more fighting.\n\nAt which point, other questions come into play:\n\n* Will sanctions finally bite in Russia, in a meaningful way?\n\n* Will Russian opposition to the war grow and influence the Kremlin?\n\n* Will U.S. and European support hold as the war moves into its second year?\n\n* And \u2014 back to that overriding question: How will it end?\n\nAmong more than 100 stories Grid has published on the war, one remains particularly relevant to that last question: \u201cIn the war in Ukraine, are \u2018a coup or a nuke\u2019 the only endgames left?\u201d Meaning, with a slog on the front lines and no sign of negotiations, are the only remaining outcomes an overthrow of Putin or a Russian use of nuclear weapons?\n\nRecently, the forecasting firm Good Judgment surveyed experts to test the likelihood of those scenarios in 2023. It found only a 9 percent chance that Putin would cease to be president of Russia and an even lower probability (5 percent) that Russia would use a nuclear weapon. Five percent is of course a frighteningly high number for such an event, but if these outcomes remain so unlikely, then what? When the Good Judgment survey asked about a negotiated settlement, more than half (55 percent) said it wouldn\u2019t happen until after Oct. 1, 2024.\n\nIn Grid\u2019s own year-end survey of experts, many said the war\u2019s chief lesson has been to expect the unexpected \u2014 or even the unthinkable. Liana Fix, fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, said too many analysts of the war had suffered from the \u201cfallacy of linear thinking\u201d; in her view, the \u201cunexpected\u201d in 2023 might include major gains by the Ukrainians and the \u201cunthinkable\u201d an end to Putin\u2019s rule.\n\n\u201cAll roads run through Beijing.\u201d That was one headline in Grid\u2019s forecast a year ago. We could reuse it now.\n\nOne could argue that 2022\u2032s most important bilateral summits involved Xi. The first came in February, when Xi and Putin met on the sidelines of the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing and declared their \u201cno-limits\u201d friendship. That friendship has been tested \u2014 it\u2019s safe to assume Xi has been unhappily surprised by the long and messy nature of Putin\u2019s war \u2014 but China has also been a much-needed \u201cfriend\u201d for the Kremlin in terms of trade and rhetorical support. How that relationship evolves will be a major question in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Xi\u2019s meeting with President Joe Biden at the November G-20 in Bali, Indonesia, offered glimmers of hope for the world\u2019s most important geopolitical relationship. After a yearslong downward spiral, the two leaders managed to avoid vitriol and pledge collaboration \u2014 most notably an agreement to resume cooperation in the fight against climate change.\n\nOn the domestic front, as Pike reported last week, China\u2019s 2023 begins with an unusually long list of worries.\n\nXi has acknowledged as much. \u201cWe face many deep-seated problems regarding reform, development and stability that cannot be avoided or bypassed,\u201d Xi told the Communist Party Congress in October. He added that China had to be \u201cprepared to withstand high winds, choppy waters and even dangerous storms on our journey ahead.\u201d\n\nSome of those storms are familiar \u2014 a property bubble, sputtering economy and relations with the West \u2014 but others are new.\n\nThe covid-19 pandemic may be receding in other parts of the world, but after China\u2019s sudden pivot away from zero-covid, caseloads are soaring. And as Pike and Jonathan Lambert reported last month, China\u2019s healthcare system appears dangerously ill-prepared for the deluge; a nation that reported only 6,000 covid fatalities in three years may be on track for hundreds of thousands of deaths in 2023. Later this month, hundreds of millions of Chinese will take advantage of relaxed rules to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see astronomical case numbers,\u201d Jennifer Bouey, an epidemiologist and leader of China studies at the Rand Corporation, told Grid.\n\nPike also noted that \u201chow China handles the messy unwinding of zero-covid \u2026 could have ripple effects well beyond China\u2019s public health \u2014 the nation\u2019s economic growth and perhaps even Xi\u2019s leadership could be called into question.\u201d\n\nFor three years, the party messages were hammered home relentlessly: Lockdowns, strict quarantines and other measures were essential to ensure the virus did not spread; and Xi regularly cheered China\u2019s tough response as a model for the world. Then came November\u2019s widespread protests against the restrictions; less than two weeks later, the policy and message were turned on their heads.\n\nXi addressed the changes for the first time in a New Year\u2019s Eve address to the nation. While the epidemic \u201cis still a struggle,\u201d he said, \u201ceveryone is working hard with perseverance. Let\u2019s work harder, persistence means victory.\u201d\n\nThe shift may ultimately prove popular, but if the unwinding of zero-covid brings a nationwide public health nightmare, huge questions loom:\n\n* How will the party explain a high death toll?\n\n* Given that public protests accelerated the change, will angry citizens be emboldened to take to the streets again?\n\n* And beyond the public health concerns, what will the covid troubles mean for China\u2019s economy?\n\nIn 2021, Xi told his people that \u201cCommon Prosperity\u201d would be the defining principle of the party\u2019s rule \u2014 a doctrine built chiefly on the promise of a fairer distribution of wealth and better life for his people. Today, it\u2019s hard to see that the regime has delivered.\n\nAs Grid has reported, income inequality and youth unemployment have risen, and in 2022, China hit an unfortunate demographic milestone: Its population has begun to shrink.\n\nThe hope is that the reopening will reinvigorate the Chinese economy. But all these problems, together with the crisis in China\u2019s property markets and whatever economic consequences come with the covid wave, paint a landscape of anxieties for the year ahead.\n\nBefore we leave China, one more note about geopolitics.\n\nConversations about the war in Ukraine turn often to implications for a potential conflict over Taiwan. In Grid\u2019s year-end look at the war\u2019s most important lessons, former Australian prime minister and Asia Society President Kevin Rudd said that \u201cUkraine is a global wake-up call, prompting us to reassess the dangers of other potential conflicts. \u2026 The most significant among these is the possibility of war between the U. S. and China. It is a prospect that we must now acknowledge is no longer unthinkable.\u201d\n\nFew experts believe a war over Taiwan is likely in 2023, but the level of concern is higher than ever \u2014 and that means that Grid Global Security Reporter Joshua Keating\u2019s piece \u201cImagining the unimaginable,\u201d which looked at how such a conflict might play out, is also more relevant than ever.\n\nAs Rudd put it, in 2023 the U. S. and China will have to make every effort to \u201cavoid sleepwalking into crisis, conflict and war.\u201d\n\nThe war in Ukraine and troubles in China will weigh heavily on the global economy in 2023 \u2014 a year that begins with a nasty mix of inflation and recession worries in many corners of the world.\n\nAll the knock-on effects of the war \u2014 the refugee crisis, the energy crisis, the crisis in the global food supply \u2014 remain in play as the year begins. A sudden end to the conflict would help on all those fronts; a war that drags into 2024 would leave the region and the world vulnerable to yet more economic trauma.\n\nInflation \u2014 driven primarily by the war \u2014 crossed the 10 percent threshold in the European Union in 2022, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported recently that the price of staples in a basket of countries had risen by 24 percent since 2020. Meanwhile, recession fears persist in parts of the European Union and the U. S. as well.\n\nChina\u2019s economic performance will loom large for the rest of the world. The farewell to zero-covid isn\u2019t just a matter of mollifying protesters; it\u2019s also meant to boost growth. The Center for China and Globalization said that expanding domestic demand will be China\u2019s main priority this year. Success would help boost global growth \u2014 but it would also increase the costs of energy and therefore the rate of inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, in several corners of the developing world, there\u2019s a different economic worry, summed up in a term we first heard in the summer of 2022: Debt bombs.\n\nAs Grid\u2019s Nikhil Kumar has reported, several countries have taken on high levels of debt that have become more burdensome as global inflation and interest rates rise. The phenomenon has squeezed budgets from Lebanon to Egypt, Kenya to Pakistan \u2014 and a debt-bomb crisis brought down the government of Sri Lanka in 2022. The problem has forced governments to cut public spending and \u2014 in many cases \u2014 petition the IMF for help.\n\nKumar wrote that as 2023 begins, \u201cthe world is left facing the very real prospect of a series of economic explosions that could affect the lives of tens of millions of its poorest people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say that 2022 was a good year for the global fight against climate change. All the urgency of the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings (the latest was held at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November) wasn\u2019t enough to avoid a conference that struggled to repeat past pledges, and despite the traumas climate change inflicted in 2022 \u2014 heat waves and fires in Europe and the American West, drought in China, deadly floods in Pakistan, to name just a few \u2014 the world has done little to stanch the bleeding.\n\nAs Grid\u2019s Dave Levitan reported from the COP27 meetings, \u201cWhile some aspects of the final text offered cause for celebration \u2026 others left the world much where it was before \u2014 in a spiraling climate emergency without a clear path to meeting goals set forth in the Paris Agreement seven years ago.\u201d\n\nAs 2023 begins, one hope is that the energy crisis sparked by the Ukraine War also sparks a rush to green energy. For the moment, two conflicting trends are in play: heavy investments in wind and solar power and the electric vehicle industry \u2014 alongside a short-term return to coal and other fossil fuels. A year-end International Energy Agency report found that coal use probably hit an all-time high in 2022.\n\nThe short-term/long-term paradox was summed up in December by Eurasia Group CEO Ian Bremmer: \u201cTake a few steps back and you see a planet that\u2019s moving away from carbon-based energy at breakneck speed, but in 2022 that transition looked anything but smooth.\u201d\n\nThese questions, then, for 2023 and beyond:\n\n* Will the rush to renewables maintain that \u201cbreakneck speed\u201d?\n\n* Will the return to coal be a brief phenomenon?\n\n* And will that reboot of U.S.-China cooperation pay dividends for the planet?\n\nAlong with Putin, Zelenskyy and Xi, a few other global leaders will be worth special attention in 2023.\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva barely won Brazil\u2019s October election \u2014 and the happy surprise in South America was what didn\u2019t happen afterward. Having vowed repeatedly to contest any outcome that didn\u2019t keep him in office, President Jair Bolsonaro scrapped the Donald Trump playbook for the most part, and on Sunday power passed peacefully to Lula, who spoke of \u201chope and reconstruction\u201d after his swearing-in. Now the challenge for Lula \u2014 and for Brazil \u2014 will be to reboot an economy that is weaker than it was at the end of his last term as president in 2010, and to do so with a powerful right-wing opposition. How he performs may be South America\u2019s most pressing question for 2023.\n\nBritain\u2019s Rishi Sunak is another newly minted leader with mountains to climb in 2023. Sunak was the third prime minister in the U. K.\u2019s annus horribilis \u2014 a year that featured the scandals that brought down Boris Johnson, the historically brief and disastrous tenure of Liz Truss, a full-blown economic crisis, and the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Sunak\u2019s main calling card is economic competence, and his main job now is to at least begin to fix the country\u2019s worst economic mess in decades. As Kumar reported, Britain is suffering from both the general European malaise and the self-inflicted economic wounds caused by Brexit.\n\nWe\u2019ll watch Kim Jong Un \u2014 because his country always bears watching and because 2022 saw a record spate of North Korean missile tests. On Sunday, Kim rang in the new year with a call for \u201cexponential\u201d growth in the country\u2019s nuclear system, according to state media. Threats and bluster are nothing new for Kim and his predecessors, but experts believe 2023 will bring the first nuclear test Kim has conducted since 2017.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan seems to have a Putinesque longevity. He played a tough geopolitical hand well in 2022, balancing ties with Moscow with drone shipments to Kyiv \u2014 and styling himself a dealmaker when it came to the crucial effort to free Ukrainian grain stocks from Black Sea ports. But Turkey starts the year with high unemployment (roughly 10 percent) and wildly high inflation (Reuters forecast a 43 percent rate for 2023), and an election looms this summer. Suffice to say Erdogan\u2019s longevity may be tested.\n\nThen to the Middle East \u2014 and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Benjamin Netanyahu, who won another term as Israeli prime minister in 2022. What are those two leaders doing in the same sentence? There are rumblings that the Saudis will be the next to make peace with Israel; in its look ahead to 2023, the Economist reported that Riyadh has invested more than $2 billion in Israeli startups, and while the two nations have little else in common, they share a deep antipathy toward Iran.\n\nWhich brings us to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. As Grid Special Contributor Roxane Farmanfarmaian wrote recently, Khamenei is not well, and his departure from the scene \u201cwould unsettle an already tense and dangerous situation\u201d in Iran. Protests sparked by one woman\u2019s death in custody have spread widely and now include demands for a change in the theocracy. Potential endgames range from brutal crackdown to civil war; key questions for the regime in 2023 are whether it will offer reforms that quiet the protesters without endangering its grip on power \u2014 and how a post-Khamenei era unfolds, if it comes to that.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll watch the Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, whose last acts of 2022 included rulings to ban high school education for girls and keep women from working at nongovernmental organizations. In response, four NGOs shut down operations in Afghanistan last week. All this comes against a backdrop of economic crisis, and as 2023 begins, the Taliban 2.0 is evolving into a regime as repressive as its earlier iteration.\n\nThere are a few things we can forecast with certainty.\n\nWe know that 2023 will bring elections in several important nations \u2014 among them Nigeria in February, Turkey in June and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in December.\n\nKing Charles III will be crowned in May.\n\nThe next major climate conference \u2014 COP28 \u2014 will gather in the United Arab Emirates in November.\n\nMeanwhile, the U. N. says that in mid-April, someone in India will give birth to the country\u2019s 1.43 billionth person \u2014 and at that moment India will surpass China as the world\u2019s most populous nation. (How the U.N. knows the timing with such precision, we\u2019re not sure.)\n\nIt\u2019s always good \u2014 and never easy \u2014 to finish such forecasts on an uplifting note. To that end, here are some of the best scenarios we can imagine.\n\nA deal is done to end the war in Ukraine, or at least to silence the guns, and it is negotiated from a position of Ukrainian strength. Fuel and food prices drop. Inflation ebbs. Other crises start earning a greater share of global attention.\n\nThe world benefits from a less turbulent U. S.-China relationship. China gets a short-term benefit from American assistance with the latest covid waves. (This would mark an interesting reversal of roles, given China\u2019s shipments of PPE and other medical equipment to the U.S. in the pandemic\u2019s early days.) Beijing beats back the worst of the covid outbreak, and life in China \u2014 along with the country\u2019s economy \u2014 returns to something more like normal.\n\nIn the rest of the world, covid-19 is no longer the all-consuming front-burner issue it has been.\n\nThe race to renewable energy outpaces the backpedaling to coal.\n\nSome measure of reforms come to Iran. Some measure of peace holds in the long-running wars in Yemen and Eritrea.\n\nFinally, perhaps the safest bet for good news comes from the world of sport. Twice in 2022 \u2014 at the Winter Olympics in Beijing and soccer\u2019s World Cup in Qatar \u2014 global gatherings of sport brought both controversy and thrills. In July 2023, another World Cup \u2014 the women\u2019s edition \u2014 will kick off in Australia and New Zealand. It\u2019s not too much to hope that this year, we\u2019ll get the thrills, minus the controversy.\n\nThanks to Lillian Barkley for copy editing this article.",

      "text": "In a stab at ideological cooperation with the Arab world, Benjamin Netanyahu's new \u201cJewish identity\u201d chief Avi Maoz could find a kindred spirit in separatist Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.\n\nIn early December, al-Sadr launched an all-out war against the LGBTQ community not only in Iraq but worldwide. The Shi'ite preacher called on his followers to pray in public against the \u201cterrible abomination\u201d and to convince a million people who oppose it to sign a manifesto.\n\nMaoz could sign this declaration with pride and joy. It states: \u201cI swear to fight against sexual deviance or against the LGTBQ community by ethical, religious and nonviolent means, and against the violation of the congenital characteristics on which humankind is built. I promise never to use violence of any kind against them. On the contrary, our goal is to guide, educate and prevent them from being drawn into forbidden lusts and the chaotic freedom of lust.\u201d\n\nSo that this polite wording won\u2019t be misunderstood, the Baghdad police are removing from streets signs, pictures and flags anything that might hint at support for the LGBTQ community. Al-Sadr\u2019s propaganda campaign spread quickly on social media, and according to the Arab Fact-Checkers Network, which combats fake news in the Arab world, al-Sadr\u2019s declaration launched the opening of over 6,300 Twitter, Facebook and Telegram accounts with names like \u201cNo to LGBTQs\u201d and \u201cNo to attacking morality.\u201d Tens of thousands of tweets and posts have been retweeted and shared.\n\nIt's hard to know what motivated al-Sadr to unleash his attack, which isn't the first of its kind, especially since Iraqi law imposes prison sentences for same-sex relations and bars LGBTQ people from serving in the army. Taking precedence over the law is a religious ruling by the top Shi\u2019ite cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, prohibiting gay relations and even ordering that LGBTQ people be punished \u2013 an order that led to the murder of about 90 members of the community in 2012.\n\nKuwait has also awakened to the fight against LGBTQ people. The first victim was a chicken fast-food chain whose slogan is \u201cOne Love,\u201d borrowed from Bob Marley. But the phrase has become a call for unity and equality among all people, battling discrimination based on origin, race, gender or sexual orientation.\n\nThe Dutch soccer association adopted the slogan in 2020, and its players wore the rainbow armband sporting the phrase. As the captain of the Dutch national team, Virgil Van Dijk, put it, \u201cOn the field everybody is equal, and this should be the case in every place in society.\u201d\n\nThis past September, nine European countries announced that they would wear the armband with the slogan at all their games, including the World Cup in Qatar. As we know, that didn\u2019t happen due to pressure from FIFA and the hosts.\n\nThe restaurant chain didn't understand why Kuwaitis on social media singled it out as a supporter of LGBTQ people. Its owners went on the defensive and explained that the \u201cOne Love\u201d signs on its restaurants referred to just one thing: \u201clove for grilled chicken and chicken fingers.\u201d\n\nThe explanation wasn't convincing and the signs were removed. They were replaced by pink-and-blue signs in the streets that made things very clear: \u201cHe isn\u2019t like me, I\u2019m a man and he\u2019s a pervert.\u201d\n\nThis is a play on words since in Arabic mithli means both \u201clike me\u201d and \u201cgay\u201d in the sense of LGBTQ. In fact, the community is dubbed \u201cthe m. community.\u201d\n\nThe only ray of light flickered for a moment at a film festival early last month in Jedda, Saudi Arabia. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been investing huge sums in the industry, which halted operations in the 1970s. These efforts are part of the crown prince's plan to vary the kingdom\u2019s sources of income, though it's mainly a lever to improve Saudi Arabia's image.\n\nA surprise awaited the many visitors to the festival, which would \u201ctake place with no censorship,\u201d its director announced. The festival included films that championed LGBTQ themes such as the 2017 hit \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d directed by Luca Guadagnino, and the new Moroccan film \u201cThe Blue Caftan,\u201d directed by Maryam Touzani, which was also shown at the Haifa International Film Festival.\n\nAs expected, the screening of these movies caused an uproar on social media in the kingdom, where it was claimed that \u201cthis is no longer a matter of films with sex scenes. This is a call to adopt sexual perversion,\u201d as one journalist wrote. It doesn't seem that the showing of \u201cThe Blue Caftan,\u201d which centers around a gay Moroccan tailor who hid his sexuality for 25 years, will change the kingdom's legal and social outlook.\n\nThe Saudi LGBTQ community is persecuted, its members subject to long prison sentences. And now Israel's aspirations to normalize ties with Riyadh can also be based on shared cultural values like the fight against the LGBTQ community.",

They were only the second host nation to depart the World Cup in the first round following South Africa in 2010. \u00a0Sanchez leaves his role as Qatar coach by mutual consent.\n\n\u201cThe past 5.5 years with Qatar\u2019s senior national team have been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I can only thank the QFA, Sheikh Hamad the president and the country\u2019s leaders for the trust and support during a period in which we achieved a lot together,\u201d said Sanchez.\n\n\u201cQatar, its people and its football will always be in my heart. Now is a good time to let others take on the responsibility of the team and for me to explore new challenges.\u201d\n\nQatar was the first Arab nation to host the World Cup but for all its financial resources the tiny country was always confronted with the problem of developing enough players to compete internationally. The Aspire Academy on the outskirts of Doha and Sanchez played a pivotal part in building Qatar\u2019s team for the World Cup.\n\nIn 2006, Sanchez arrived from Barcelona\u2019s La Masia academy. With his experience from one of the most hallowed schools of football, the Spaniard built a new team, winning the U-19 Asian Cup, Qatar\u2019s first-ever continental title in 2014.\n\nThat generation, including Akram Afif, Almoez Ali, Tarek Salman, Assim Madibo, Salem Al-Hajri and goalkeeper Youssef Hassan went on to win the 2019 Asian Cup, playing 4-3-3 and some swashbuckling football. In 2021 the same team reached the semi-finals of Concacaf\u2019s Gold Cup. But perhaps Qatar had peaked too early because they never rekindled that form and following a bizarre preparation for the finals on home soil they were no match for the Netherlands, Ecuador and Senegal in Group A.\n\nQatar Football Association president Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani thanked Sanchez for his work and time in Qatar.\n\n\u201cFelix has been not only our coach, but also our friend. The football family of Qatar will always be grateful for the success he has brought to Qatar football over the years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCoach Felix will always have a special place with us and we hope he always thinks of Qatar as his home.\u201d\n\nSanchez\u2019s successor will have no easy task as Qatar will host their defence of the next Asian Cup in January 2024.\n\nContact the writer of this story at moc.llabtoofdlrowedisni@itnuk.ardnimas",

Shocking! Would he dare compare anyone to other God of other religions? After denying Ram ji existence, blocking Ram Mandir now insult of Hindu Astha!

MMI, one of Dubai\u2019s biggest alcohol retailers and a subsidiary of the state-owned Emirates group, has 21 stores across the city, according to its website.\n\nAfrican + Eastern, another drinks retailer, said on its Instagram page on Sunday that it had removed the tax and that it was now offering personal liquor licenses at zero cost.\n\nMuslims are prohibited from acquiring licenses for purchase of alcohol in Dubai.\n\nCNN has contacted the Dubai government media office for comment.\n\nThe changes will be in place for one year as part of a trial period, Reuters reported, citing domestic media sources.\n\nFacing emerging competition from countries in the region, several UAE cities have shifted toward globally attractive policies over the past years, including the legalization of cohabitation by unmarried couples, and allowing the sale of alcohol during the holy month of Ramadan, which was previously banned across the country.\n\nMost recently, a Monday to Friday work week was introduced to synchronize with global business, after years of a Sunday to Thursday schedule.\n\nThe sale of alcohol in the UAE is already more liberalized compared to neighboring Gulf countries. Almost 90% of its population is made up of foreigners.\n\nInternational visitors spent more than $29 billion in Dubai in 2022, the most of anywhere in the world, according to data from the World Travel and Tourism Council.\n\nBut the city faces increasing competition from its neighbor, Saudi Arabia, which is investing heavily in its own tourism sector as it diversifies its economy away from oil.\n\nCrown Prince Mohamed bin Salman is trying to rebrand the kingdom\u2019s image away from a conservative Muslim country to attract global businesses, talent and tourism. Parts of its Red Sea Global resort, which includes a collection of mega-hotels, are due to open this year.",

      "text": "Rio Ferdinand has defended Cristiano Ronaldo following his move to Saudi Arabia club Al-Nassr, comparing the switch to the swansongs enjoyed by former Manchester United stars Wayne Rooney and David Beckham in the United States.\n\nRonaldo confirmed his move to the Saudi Arabian side on a sensational \u00a3175million-a-year contract on Friday following his tumultuous exit from Manchester United in November.\n\nRonaldo, 37, had been a free agent after leaving United in the wake of his damning and controversial interview with Piers Morgan, with fans now flocking to social media to claim he is \u2018so done\u2019 after moving to the Middle East.\n\nFerdinand has hit back after Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher expressed \u2018sadness\u2019 at the move, with the Sky Sports pundits saying the move marked the end of Ronaldo playing at the highest level.\n\nFerdinand claimed \u2018no man on the planet\u2019 had earned the right to the move more than the Portuguese star.\n\n\u201cIt was great to see David Beckham, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard, it was great to see them go to America,\u201d Ferdinand said on his Vibe with FIVE podcast. \u201cWhat a way to finish their careers, getting great money, going to a league that\u2019s not as competitive, they\u2019ve deserved that, they\u2019ve earned the right.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I saw in the media. But because it\u2019s Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s a disgrace, its sad. Let a man go and live, let a man go and enjoy it. It\u2019s a new adventure he\u2019s taking his family to experience a new culture.\n\n\u201cEvery single country in the world has its issues, so America have got less issues than Saudi, have they? But it\u2019s fine for all these players to go to America. Let\u2019s let them go to the States and have a swansong year and just toss it off.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it. It stinks we\u2019re not hearing this type of talk. It\u2019s out of order.\n\n\u201cEveryone should be treated the same. Every other player that\u2019s gone to a less competitive league to end his or her career has been told you\u2019ve earned the right. No man on the planet would have earned the right more than this guy, (Ronaldo).\u201d\n\nReports in Saudi Arabia have stated that Ronaldo has signed on a two-year deal.\n\nThe \u00a3175m-a-year contract sees him become the highest-paid player in world football, with his contract set to run until June 2025, when he will be 39.\n\nThe Saudi Pro League club announced his arrival in a tweet saying: \u201cThe world\u2019s greatest athlete officially signed for Al-Nassr\u201d, with Ronaldo also taking up an ambassadorial role.\n\nPart of his role as an ambassador will be to help Saudi Arabia\u2019s joint bid with Egypt and Greece to host the 2030 World Cup, it has been claimed.\n\nHe joins archrival Lionel Messi in taking up a promotional position with the gulf nation, which has faced criticism for its human rights record, as well as crackdowns on women\u2019s rights activists, LGBTQ+ people and those who speak out against the rule of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nRonaldo\u2019s move has also faced social media criticism, after footage resurfaced of star claiming he wants to \u2018finish at the top level\u2019, where he listed the \u2018USA, Qatar or Dubai\u2019 as places he couldn\u2019t envision playing at later in his career.\n\nAl-Nassr are one of the most successful clubs in Saudi Arabia, having being crowned winners of the country\u2019s top flight nine times, with their most recent triumph coming in 2019.\n\nRonaldo had previously been linked with the likes of Chelsea, Atletico Madrid and Napoli after stunning United officials by telling the club he wanted out in the summer transfer window.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner had reportedly expressed hope Real Madrid would want to sign him for a second time.\n\nRonaldo is a Bernabeu legend, having scored 450 goals in 438 matches for Real over nine seasons to help them to four Champions League triumphs.",

Now a younger generation is devising new modes of telling the story and finding new stories to tell. Save this story for later.The moral power of Partition writing has come from its sustained confrontations with violence, especially against women.Save this story for later.Before it was an edict, and a death sentence, it was a rumor. To many, it must have seemed improbable; I imagine my grandmother, buying her vegetables at the market, settling her baby on her hip, craning to hear the news\u2014a border, where? Two borders, to be exact. On the eve of their departure, in 1947, after more than three hundred years on the subcontinent, the British sliced the land into a Hindu-majority India flanked by a Muslim-majority West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), a thousand miles apart. The boundaries were drawn up in five weeks by an English barrister who had famously never before been east of Paris; he flew home directly afterward and burned his papers. The slash of his pen is known as Partition.A tidy word, \u201cPartition.\u201d Amid what the Punjabis call the raula\u2014the \u201cuproar\u201d\u2014the region convulsed with violence, Hindus and Sikhs on one side, Muslims on the other. Entire villages were massacred. Neighbors turned on each other. It\u2019s estimated that a million people were killed, and that seventy-five thousand women and girls were abducted and raped, a third of them under the age of twelve. Millions of refugees fled in one of the largest and most rapid migrations in history. \u201cBlood trains\u201d crisscrossed the fresh border, carrying silent cargo\u2014passengers slaughtered during the journey. Cities transformed into open-air refugee camps, like the one in Delhi to which my grandmother escaped in the night, alone with her children, feeding the baby opium, the story goes, so he would not cry. Bhisham Sahni\u2019s \u201cTamas,\u201d a 1973 Hindi novel set in that period, brings such a camp to life. The exhausted refugees are greeted by a functionary of the Relief Committee with the unpropitious nickname Statistics Babu. \u201cI want figures, only figures, nothing but figures,\u201d he instructs. The refugees mill around him, unhearing. They weep, stare blankly. They repeat, in exasperating detail, every step of their journeys. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you understand?\u201d Statistics Babu pleads. \u201cI am not here to listen to the whole \u2018Ramayana.\u2019 Give me figures\u2014how many dead, how many wounded, how much loss of property and goods. That is all.\u201dIs that where the story lies? What do \u201cfigures, only figures\u201d convey of the full horror and absurdity of 1947? Of a border that cut through forests, families, and shrines, that saw wild animals apportioned between the two countries and historical artifacts snapped in half? In \u201cTamas,\u201d the testimonies of the survivors reveal all that records omit and conceal. A refugee is desperate to recover his wife\u2019s gold bangles: won\u2019t Statistics Babu help him? Those bangles still circle his wife\u2019s wrists, however, and she lies at the bottom of a well. It is a detail perhaps lifted from the case of the real-life village of Thoa Khalsa, now in Pakistan, where almost a hundred Sikh women drowned themselves and their children. We don\u2019t have the figures for women killed by their own families or forced to kill themselves in the name of protecting their honor. There are no records of those who died of heartbreak. My family migrated from an area not far from Thoa Khalsa. Only my great-uncle remained; he lay beheaded in the courtyard of his home. Three months later, his wife died\u2014of grief, some say. Their children were scattered. There are no firm figures available for orphaned children, or for children abandoned along the journey because they were too small to walk quickly enough.The Best Books of 2022Read our reviews of the year\u2019s notable new fiction and nonfiction.This past year has marked seventy-five years of Partition, a process of fracturing that continues in the imagination and in memory. Each generation has posed new questions, searching for places where the stories can be found\u2014in statistics, in stubborn reticence, in a pair of gold bangles. A sturdy consensus long held that the fullest account of 1947 could be found not in facts and figures\u2014not in nonfiction at all\u2014but in texts like \u201cTamas,\u201d in literature. We were steered strenuously away from the scholarship and toward fiction and poetry\u2014often by the scholars themselves. \u201cCreative writers have captured the human dimensions of Partition far more effectively than have historians,\u201d the scholar Ayesha Jalal has written. Novels were said to surpass even survivor testimonies for vividness and accuracy. Two decades ago, Akash Kapur, writing in the Times about a landmark work of Partition oral history, directed the reader back to \u201cthe excellent fiction\u201d of Partition, such as Khushwant Singh\u2019s \u201cTrain to Pakistan\u201d (1956), which \u201cdoes a far better job of evoking the terror, the bewilderment and the remorse that still shadow so many lives on the subcontinent.\u201dPartition literature fills a long shelf. There is early fiction by survivors and spectators: realist narratives (Singh\u2019s \u201cTrain to Pakistan\u201d), feminist epics (Yashpal\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not That Dawn\u201d), stripped-down, nightmarish short stories (Saadat Hasan Manto\u2019s \u201cBlack Margins\u201d). In the nineteen-eighties came a new flourishing, with now canonical novels by Salman Rushdie (\u201cMidnight\u2019s Children\u201d), Amitav Ghosh (\u201cShadow Lines\u201d), and Bapsi Sidhwa (\u201cIce Candy Man\u201d). Certain tropes and tendencies repeat. There is a reliance on coming-of-age stories, in which the loss of the nation\u2019s innocence maps neatly onto a character\u2019s; twins illustrate a conjoined fate; a dead woman personifies the fractured motherland. (These tropes are so alluring that a recent American young-adult novel about Partition, Veera Hiranandani\u2019s \u201cThe Night Diary,\u201d combined all of them, in a coming-of-age story about a twin born to a mother who dies in childbirth.)But the unity, and moral power, of the genre derives from its sustained confrontations with the violence of Partition. The official narrative of independence was one of celebration. \u201cBefore the birth of freedom we have endured all the pains of labor and our hearts are heavy with the memory of this sorrow,\u201d Jawaharlal Nehru announced on August 14, 1947, as independence and Partition were imminent. \u201cNevertheless, the past is over and it is the future that beckons to us.\u201d The killings were portrayed as a spasm of collective madness, a regrettable development on the path to progress. In fact, it was the efficiency and organization of the attacks that came to distinguish the episode, and its stamp was the targeting and torture of women.What we call Partition fiction might be more pointedly described as one of the most extensive bodies of literature committed to cataloguing rape and sexual terrorism\u2014the frenzy that left corpses riddled with bite marks, pregnant women slit open, and religious slogans branded upon faces and genitals. What Nehru dismissed as labor pains, what films dealt with obliquely, and some families not at all, is bluntly documented in the novels\u2014the grisly discovery in \u201cIce Candy Man,\u201d for example, of a bag stuffed with severed breasts. Novels filled in the extensive gaps in the archives. \u201cThere were no trials for perpetrators of violence, the authorities took no statements, and very little data was gathered,\u201d the historian Manan Ahmed has written. \u201cEven the trains, which ran covered in blood across the Punjab border, were scrubbed clean.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. In fact, the only physical traces left are the people themselves. And they too shucked their old identities for fear of more violence.\u201dIf it seems crude to treat literature as testimony, we cannot ignore the fact that some writers conceived of themselves as eyewitnesses. They shared a commitment to preserve not only what went unsaid but what felt unsayable\u2014that the violence of Partition was not necessarily an aberration in the lives of women, for one. The upheaval could be liberation\u2014the domestic spaces to which women were confined could protect but also imprison, as Daisy Rockwell notes in the afterword to her translation of Khadija Mastur\u2019s 1962 novel, \u201cThe Woman\u2019s Courtyard.\u201d As early as 1950, Amrita Pritam\u2019s novel \u201cPinjar\u201d examined the refusal of families to take back women and girls who had been abducted and \u201ccontaminated.\u201d The sexual violation of men during that period remains a taboo subject; I find mention of castrations in \u201cTrain to Pakistan\u201d and almost nowhere else.This is the work of the novel: to notice, knit, remember, record. The novel confers wholeness and unity to a story of division. The novel\u2014it cannot help itself\u2014reconciles. But it was only by taking a truncheon to the form that some of the greatest Partition fiction was created. Out of the rubble of the cities and the scorched fields emerged Saadat Hasan Manto\u2019s glittering, razored shards. A recent collection, \u201cThe Dog of Tithwal,\u201d gathers classics by the Urdu master of the short story. Born in 1912 to a Kashmiri family in the northern state of Punjab, Manto fell under the spell of Gorky and Poe, not to mention the rotgut that would kill him at the age of forty-two. Fluent in almost every genre, he wrote while sitting on the family sofa, his daughters climbing over him as he churned out polemics, screenplays, and twenty-two volumes of short stories marked by a warm, coarse, and occasionally menacing sexuality that so agitated the censors. He was tried for (and acquitted of) obscenity six times; his story \u201cKhol Do\u201d was condemned as an incitement to rape. Partition tore him from Mumbai, his home and muse. Marooned in Lahore, he began writing furiously about what he had seen. The most famous of these stories, \u201cToba Tek Singh,\u201d tells the tale\u2014based in fact\u2014of India and Pakistan dividing up patients of mental institutions according to their religion. One Sikh inmate cannot figure out which country his village belongs to; he roots himself between the barbed-wire fences of each border, and dies on a patch of unclaimed earth.Manto established his distinctive form in the book \u201cBlack Margins\u201d (1948): thirty-two sketches of compressed power, some no more than a few sentences long, which brought to life the obscene logic of the new world. In \u201cThe Advantage of Ignorance,\u201d a sniper takes aim at a child. His companion objects, but not for the expected reason. \u201cYou are out of bullets,\u201d he exclaims. In \u201cDouble Cross,\u201d a character complains about being sold bad petrol\u2014it won\u2019t set fire to any shops. The stories are not just expressions of shock; they are modes of refusal\u2014a response to facts that will not, ought not, be easily assimilated into a narrative. The ink feels fresh, wet. Manto remains our eternal contemporary, his capacity to unnerve undiminished.Even his admirers can be caught trying to tame him\u2014pushing him into earnest ethical stances. In the introduction to the recent collection, the poet Vijay Seshadri describes Manto\u2019s Urdu as firm, spare, and \u201ceasily accessible to translation.\u201d In truth, Manto frightens his translators. The rehabilitation mission starts with them. Khalid Hasan begins his translation by defanging the title of \u201cKhol Do,\u201d which Manto is said to have considered his best work. Hasan names it \u201cThe Return,\u201d instead of the literal translation, \u201cOpen It\u201d\u2014the command issued in the story\u2019s chilling climax. As it begins, a Muslim girl has clearly been abducted by a Hindu mob. Men from her community go in search of her. When her father spots them accompanying a body, the reader understands that the girl, Sakina, has been attacked again, by the very men who promised to rescue her. She is brought to a hospital, seemingly lifeless. A doctor enters the small, stifling room, and gestures to a window: \u201cOpen it.\u201d There is a jerk of movement; Sakina\u2019s hands move to untie the drawstring of her pants and lower them down her thighs. Her father exults\u2014\u201cShe is alive\u201d\u2014and the doctor breaks into a cold sweat.There\u2019s a crucial line in the story. In Urdu, it reads, \u201cSakina ke murda jism mein jumbish hui.\u201d Hasan has variously translated it as \u201cThe young woman on the stretcher moved slightly\u201d and \u201cSakina\u2019s body stirred.\u201d A more faithful translation would be something like \u201cThere was a movement in Sakina\u2019s corpse.\u201d It was Hasan who respectfully refers to Sakina as \u201cthe young woman,\u201d Hasan who wants her still to be Sakina. Manto refers to her corpse. He is interested in the threshold that she has crossed, what the doctor notices and the father cannot\u2014the threshold we keep encountering in his stories about Partition.Manto\u2019s fiction routinely blurs the line between life and death, sanity and madness. Characters merge with their weapons. (In \u201cThe Last Salute,\u201d a platoon leader \u201cfelt as though he had turned into a rifle, but one whose trigger was jammed.\u201d) Weapons act as agents in their own right. (From \u201cMishtake\u201d: \u201cRipping the belly cleanly, the knife moved in a straight line down the midriff, in the process slashing the cord which held the man\u2019s pajamas in place.\u201d) These transformations occur beyond the characters\u2019 awareness. You will cross the threshold without knowing, Manto seems to say. You will not be able to see what you have become. There is no self-knowledge or remorse, no greater sense of justice than there was in 1947. Nor does the author permit himself the reprieve of moralizing. There are only loops of retribution. \u201cBitter Harvest\u201d begins with a Muslim father screaming the name of his young daughter, who has been raped and murdered: \u201cSharifan! Sharifan!\u201d The story ends with him seizing, raping, and strangling a Hindu girl, leaving her father to find the body and scream her name: \u201cBimla, my daughter, Bimla.\u201dIn the past generation, though, Partition \u201cshimmered away as a suitable subject\u201d for fiction, in the words of the literary critic Nilanjana Roy. The mantle was taken up by oral historians. Recurrent eruptions of violence reawakened memories of the killings of 1947\u2014its unfinished business, the rot in the wound. The 2002 Gujarat riots, in particular, shared the grammar of Partition violence: the frenzy masking careful co\u00f6rdination, the targeting of women, the impunity. The feminist writer and publisher Urvashi Butalia\u2019s \u201cThe Other Side of Silence\u201d (1998) had been sparked by the Sikh massacres of 1984, which led her to think more deeply about her family\u2019s history. Through interviews with survivors, Butalia traced a story of Partition as its meaning was shaped (and evaded) in private life, in families. This was Partition seen from the perspective of women, children, Dalits, all those left out of the grand political narratives, and told with the kind of feeling and detail that, as the scholar Deepti Misri writes, could never have made it into Statistics Babu\u2019s ledger. The testimonies compiled by Butalia\u2014as well as by Ashis Nandy, Veena Das, Ritu Menon, and Kamla Bhasin\u2014rippled with complexities and contradiction. Memories of loss exist, sometimes queasily, alongside memories of gain\u2014the birth of nations, the pride of survival, the unexpected opportunities created in the upheaval. I was weaned on stories of my family\u2019s Partition: my beheaded kinsman; my grandmother wheedling extra rations for her children in the camps; the two young girls, sisters, who went missing. Beneath these stories pulsed the uncomfortable knowledge that the very tumult of Partition allowed some families like mine, living under the boot of brutal feudal hierarchy, their first opportunity to prise themselves free.In the past few decades, popular chroniclers influenced both by fiction and by oral history have taken up polyphonic approaches. Yasmin Khan\u2019s \u201cThe Great Partition\u201d and Vazira Fazila-Yacoobali Zamindar\u2019s \u201cThe Long Partition and the Making of Modern South Asia,\u201d both published in 2007, at the sixtieth anniversary of the event, synthesized Statistics Babu\u2019s facts and figures with the testimonies of survivors. More expansive histories of Partition began to be told, attending to the links between 1947 and the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, the migration of Dalits, and the effects of Partition on tribal communities, on Kashmir, on the diaspora.At its seventy-fifth anniversary, Partition has found still more eclectic forms. The new generation coming to the story\u2014midnight\u2019s grandchildren\u2014are not scholars, for the most part. They typically have no specialized credentials. Theirs is a different qualification: this is their inheritance. They include the New York rapper Heems, who describes himself as a \u201cproduct of Partition\u201d; the installation artist Pritika Chowdhry, who constructs \u201canti-memorials\u201d; Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, an Oscar-winning filmmaker and the founder of the Citizen Archive of Pakistan (CAP); and Guneeta Singh Bhalla, a physicist who has established a crowdsourced library of testimonies. It\u2019s no longer enough for fiction to fill the silences. These self-taught archivists search for whatever evidence they can find; they build on the work of oral historians like Butalia, finding the archives in the last remaining survivors.Their ranks are thinning. That young woman, so startled by the rumors, who fled with her children\u2014my grandmother\u2014died in 2006. Her eldest child, the child who could walk\u2014my aunt\u2014died last year. Organizations like Obaid-Chinoy\u2019s CAP and Bhalla\u2019s 1947 Partition Archive gather testimonies with fresh urgency. Online communities invite survivors to upload their stories or find childhood friends. Project Dastaan, an organization formed by students at Oxford, not only collects testimonies but also offers refugees a chance to \u201cvisit\u201d their homeland using virtual-reality headsets.This cohort of oral historians has confronted a reticence born not only of suffering but also of shame, arising from complicity, intimate betrayals\u2014Manto\u2019s thresholds. \u201cThe true horror is not what your neighbors did to you,\u201d the historian Faisal Devji notes, \u201cbut what your own family members might have done out of force of necessity: Leave somebody behind who was handicapped, who was unable to walk or flee.\u201dIn \u201cRemnants of Partition\u201d (2019), Aanchal Malhotra, a Delhi-based artist turned oral historian, devised a method to sidestep the silences. Her grandparents, Punjabi migrants from Pakistan, were skillful at thwarting her questions about their journey, but conversations suddenly bloomed when she asked what they carried with them. Her great-uncle produced a ghara, a metallic vessel for churning yogurt, and a gaz, a yardstick from the family tailoring business. He absently handled the objects as he spoke; they stimulated memories of a rich, associative, unexpected kind, full of longing. Malhotra took the same question to her grandmother, and to other survivors. Her book is a history of Partition told in twenty-one possessions: a string of pearls, a sword. These objects are not relics; many are pointedly, movingly, still in use. Her grandmother travelled across the border with a small folding knife given to her by her family, who told her to use it against attackers or on herself. The same blade, \u201cswallowed by rust,\u201d now accompanies Malhotra\u2019s grandmother on her morning walks, as she slices leaves from an aloe plant\u2014the weapon transformed into an agent of healing.The music video opens in a train station\u2014the archetypal setting of Partition horror. The windows are shattered; debris lies scattered on the floor. The waiting area fills with passengers, looking at one another warily. A man sitting alone on a bench begins to sing a ghazal by the Pakistani poet (and Partition migrant) Saifuddin Saif: \u201cThis moonlit night has been a long time coming\u00a0/\u00a0The words I want to say have been a long time coming.\u201d The mood warms. A traveller darns another\u2019s torn clothing; a woman admires another\u2019s baby.\u201cChandni Raat,\u201d an Urdu single from the Pakistani American singer Ali Sethi, was released in 2019, just days before fighting broke out between India and Pakistan. Once again, war seemed imminent. The YouTube comment section of the accompanying music video became a gathering place much like the train station\u2019s waiting area. Strangers congregated, invoking the song\u2019s message of unity. \u201cIt became kind of an anthem,\u201d Sethi says. \u201cIt felt genuinely miraculous.\u201dThe son of prominent journalists, Sethi grew up in Lahore\u2014\u201ca haunted city,\u201d he calls it. The old part of the city was full of signs of the people who fled, some sixty per cent of the population; home alcoves once reserved for shrines now held a refrigerator or an electric fan. \u201cFor me, turning to Hindustani music was the only way I could unpartition myself\u2014go back to a place that was not only pre-Partition but pre-colonial,\u201d he says. Hindustani music, as he describes it, is sacred and secular, a mongrel of Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim traditions. He was taught by two renowned singers, both Partition migrants, and during the COVID lockdown he used social media to bring together musicians from across the border to collaborate. He cites a teacher of his who taught him that metaphors \u201chelp us to dialogue across distances.\u201d Song, he says, is a space we can live inside. Just as the little knife of Malhotra\u2019s grandmother was repurposed, the train station in the \u201cChandni Raat\u201d video has been, too\u2014a place of death reconceived as a place of reconciliation.Violence has long felt emblematic of the story of Partition\u2014it was what lurked in Manto\u2019s \u201cblack margins\u201d\u2014and that history of violence is now deployed as a political weapon, stoking suspicion, retribution. Anam Zakaria, who works on cross-cultural exchange between India and Pakistan, describes younger generations\u2014who have grown up in the shadow of war\u2014as even more hostile toward one another than the generation who survived Partition. India\u2019s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, recently declared August 14th to be Partition Horrors Remembrance Day. By choosing the date of Pakistan\u2019s independence day (India celebrates August\u00a015th as its day of independence), and by carefully referring to those denied \u201ccremation,\u201d Modi framed it as an occasion to mourn only Hindu and Sikh victims, and to single out Muslims as aggressors. A younger generation struggles not just to devise new modes of accessing and telling the story of Partition but also to prevent it from being used to justify further bloodletting. They want to return the event to survivors and their families\u2014and to highlight memories and emotions that have been occluded by the fixation on carnage. Malhotra asks, \u201cWhy do we immediately think of the trains? Why don\u2019t we think of the friendship left behind or the love affairs that may have gotten cut?\u201d Kavita Puri, a BBC journalist, similarly wants to see beyond the brutalities: \u201cPartition, though filled with horror in so many ways, is also a story about love.\u201d Can the story of Partition be told in a different genre? Will love stories keep the blood at bay?In \u201cTomb of Sand,\u201d the winner of the 2022 International Booker Prize, Geetanjali Shree pays homage to Partition fiction, imagining the great novelists gathering near the border. \u201cThe group of Partition writers has come to sit in a row, and every person has a name card at their place like at a formal banquet. Bhisham Sahni. Balwant Singh. Joginder Pal. Manto. Rahi Masoom Raza. Shaani. Intizar Hussain. Krishna Sobti. Khushwant Singh. Ramanand Sagar. Manzoor Ehtesham. Rajinder Singh Bedi.\u201d Yet Shree also explores the possibility of writing one\u2019s own story of Partition. Ma, the central figure in the novel, an eighty-year-old widow, spends more than a hundred pages of the book lying in bed, her back to the reader, before finally, heroically, reclaiming her life, by going back across the border to Pakistan and falling in love.does not enclose, it opens out. It creates a shape\u2014it adorns an edge. This side of the edging blossoms, as does that. Embroider the border with a shimmering vine. Stud it with precious stones. What is a border? It enhances a personality. It gives strength. It doesn\u2019t tear apart. A border increases recognition. Where two sides meet and both flourish. A border ornaments their meeting.Partition stories offer few consolations; one wants to hold this one tightly in hand, like Grandmother\u2019s little knife. But what is that folded blade but sheathed violence? Has it completed its work? How does one begin to tell a tale so turbulently in progress? \u201cIt will jump, it will cross over, the story will not end,\u201d Shree writes. Manto\u2019s shards, unblunted by any urge toward narrative neatness, find their mark for a reason.There\u2019s a quiet detail in \u201cThe Dog of Tithwal,\u201d one planted delicately, as if designed to be lost amid the gaudy violence. The Pakistani Army and the Indian Army gather on two hills, facing each other. Between bursts of gunfire, the soldiers sing. Only the reader can know that they are both singing a folk song of romance and longing. The reader experiences, at first, a frisson of recognition\u2014ah, to be so alike, on either side of a divide. But how little it matters, once the action of the story is under way. Both sides send a dog back and forth, frightening and torturing it to death. The dog cannot hear the singing; he cannot name the song. Sing whatever you like while you can, the writer seems to say. The black margins are closing in.\u00a0\u2666",

      "text": "The management of Summit Bank has planned to transform the operation of the bank from interest-based to Shariah-based banking mode in the next three years.\n\nIn accordance with the plan, scholars of the Shariah Board have recently reviewed the management\u2019s decision and given its green signal for the conversion of the bank from a conventional to a full-fledged Islamic bank.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that the board of directors of the bank earlier had the same conversion plan in 2016 which was revoked in the subsequent months as the management and the board preferred an opportunity to pursue another plan, that is, the bank\u2019s merger with Sindh Bank.\n\nTherefore, the two banks continued to work on sealing the merger deal in accordance with the required process and approval of the relevant authorities successfully but the amalgamation plan of the two banks was objected in the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP), which called off the deal ultimately in 2019.\n\nIn the meantime, various cases were filed against the Chairman and CEO of the bank for their alleged involvement in financial embezzlement.\n\nIn 2021, the bank once again came into the limelight after Dubai-based investor Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah announced the acquisition of the majority shareholding (51 percent) of the bank at 2.51 per share. Media tycoon, Salman Iqbal also joined him as part of the consortium.\n\nAt present, the bank is operating nearly 50 branches Islamic branches out of 195 overall branches. Its assets and deposit stood at Rs. 23 billion and Rs. 20 billion, respectively. The bank is not opening new branches of its conventional bank but converting its established branches into Islamic banking branches.\n\nThe Islamic banking division of the bank made a profit of Rs. 551 million by the end of September 2022. On the contrary, the bank posted an overall loss of nearly Rs. 2 billion by the end of September last year.\n\nSummit Bank is one of the unique banks in the history of Pakistan\u2019s banking industry which was formed after the merger of Rupali Bank, Atlast Bank, and MyBank.\n\nThe Bank has incurred a net loss of Rs. 1.994 billion resulting in accumulated losses of Rs. 40.6 billion and negative equity of Rs. 16.515 \u00a0billion. As per the applicable laws and regulations, the bank is required to maintain Minimum Paid-up Capital (net of losses) (MCR) of Rs. 10 billion, Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 11.50 percent.\n\nIn 2023, Pakistan\u2019s banking landscape witnessed a complete conversion of Faysal Bank into a full-fledged Islamic bank.\n\nThe successful conversion may give the confidence to devise a conversion plan for becoming a full-fledged Islamic bank in order to tap the high demand for Shariah-based banking services in the country including adhering to the instruction of the Federal Shariah Court towards the elimination of the Riba-based economy.",

      "text": "After the song \u2018Shameless Rang\u2019 from Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s upcoming film, \u2018Pathan\u2019 became a victim of controversy, various claims are being made on social media. One of them is that there is not a single Hindu cricketer and actor in Pakistan-Bangladesh, while superstars Salman, Aamir, and Shahrukh \u2018Pathan\u2019 will be found in 100 crore Hindus.\n\nA user named Thakur Amit Singh Hindu tweeted a critical video of the film \u2018Pathan\u2019 and captioned: \u201c You will not find a single Hindu film actor or cricketer in Pakistan and Bangladesh, but despite being 100 crore Hindus in India, superstar Salman, Aamir Shah Rukh Pathan will be found Whose fault is it?\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, many other social media users are sharing a similar claim-\n\nTo know the reality of the viral claim, the DFRAC team conducted a simple search with the help of some special keywords. During this time we got many reports published by different media houses.\n\nAccording to a report published by Zee News, Anil Dalpat Sonwaria, the first Hindu player of the Pakistan cricket team, started his career as a wicketkeeper-batsman in 1984. He could not very successful in the Pakistan team and could play only 9 Test matches.\n\nDanish Kaneria was the last non-Muslim player to play for the Pakistan cricket team. Kaneria started his international career in the year 2000 and he played 61 Test matches for Pakistan and was also very successful. Kaneria is the highest run bowler for Pakistan with 261 Test wickets.\n\nAfter this, the DFRAC team searched Google with the help of some keywords and tried to find out how many Hindu cricketers are there in Bangladesh. During this time, we have been presented in the report published by Tech Duniya under the title \u201cThose 21 Hindu Cricketers Who Have Shown Their Jalwa in The Bangladesh Team\u201d.\n\nLintandas is the current captain of the Bangladesh ODI cricket team.\n\nAt the same time, we found a list of non-Muslim players who have made a name in the world of Bangladesh\u2019s sports on the Wikipedia page, which can be seen by clicking here.\n\nAfter the world of cricket, the DFRAC team did a simple search on Google with the help of some keywords to know about Pakistani and Bangladeshi Hindu celebrities in the acting world. In the results, we found many reports published by different media houses.\n\nThe report, published by nayadaur and hiddenbodyfacts, talks about ten non-Muslim actors/actresses, including Bapsi Sidhwa, Deepak Parwani and Sunita Marshall, who made a name for themselves in pakistan\u2019s acting world.\n\nAt the same time, the DFRAC team searched to know about the Hindu actor/actress in Bangladesh. According to the information given on the Wikipedia page, many names including Manoj Kumar Parmanik, Chanchal Chaudhary, and Bidiya Sinha Saas Meme came up.\n\nApart from these, it can also be seen on the website IMDB that there is a good number, who have made a name in the world of advertising in Bangladesh.\n\nIt is clear from this fact check of DFRAC that the claim being made by users that you will not find a single Hindu film actor or cricketer in Pakistan and Bangladesh is fake and misleading. Because in Pakistan and Bangladesh too, many Hindu cricketers and actors/actresses have proved and are proving their skills.",

      "text": "The apostate author Salman Rushdie, who\u00a0was stabbed\u00a0on Friday at a literary event in New York state, is on a ventilator and unable to speak, Aljazeera reported.\n\nThe source added that Rushdie is on a ventilator after the attack and suffered a wound to his liver and might lose an eye in the wake of the knife attack.\n\nRita Landman, an endocrinologist who was in the audience, said that Rushdie had multiple stab wounds, including one to the right side of his neck, and that there was a pool of blood under his body, the New York Times reported.\n\nMultiple witnesses said the attacker was able to reach Rushdie easily, running onstage and approaching him from behind.\n\n***But who Salman Rushdie is!\n\nRushdie was born in Bombay (now Mumbai) in India in 1947. As a teenager, he went to school in England, where he eventually settled. He began his career writing copy for an advertising firm, and he started writing fiction. He published his first novel, \u201cGrimus,\u201d in 1975.\n\nRushdie is the author of \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d, a blasphemous novel about Islam published in 1988 which sparked Muslims\u2019 outrage across the globe.\n\nThe Indian-born British author was forced into hiding in 1989 after his book The Satanic Verses was denounced by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Many considered the book blasphemous in its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad. The book was banned in several countries, Aljazeera reported.\n\nThe British-Indian author currently lives in the United States.\n\nIn early 1989, Imam Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the execution of Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British author.\n\nImam Khomeini stated that the action against Rushdie was a religious duty for Muslims because of his alleged blasphemy against Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) in his novel \"The Satanic Verses\".\n\nImam Khomeini was totally rejecting any act of violence and terrorism, which are basically against the Islamic laws and jurisprudence. In this case, also Imam just undertook to issue a decree in accordance with the laws of Islam on Rushdie's act, while others may directly go for execution and then take the responsibility.\n\nBoth Shi\u2018a and Sunni Muslim jurisprudents have concessions and decrees on the issue of heresy.\n\n\u201cApostasy\u201d is an Islamic jurisprudential ruling and is issued to those who rebuff converting to Islam and means execution.\n\nWhat Salman Rushdie, a British-Indian writer, wrote about Qur'anic verses and insults to Muslims as \"Satanic Verses\" was not an unplanned event. Especially when Western, Israeli, American, and British media outlets threw their weight behind Salman Rushdie.\n\nImam\u2019s decree on Rushdie was supported by many Islamic scholars either in the UK or in the entire Muslim world. It was regarded as a sign of protest and opposition to those who had fostered in mind to degrade the position of the Holy Prophet of Islam (pbuh) and show disrespect for the Muslim world\u2019s sanctities.\n\n***Reactions on the attack; A plot or incident?\n\nAn advisor to the Iranian negotiating team reacted to the attack on Salman Rushdie, the author of a blasphemous anti-Islam book, and described it as an odd incident regarding the ongoing Vienna talks.\n\n\"I won't be shedding tears for a writer who spouts endless hatred & contempt for Muslims & Islam. A pawn of empire who poses as a Postcolonial novelist,\"\u00a0Mohammad Marandi, who is also vice-president for international affairs at the University of Tehran tweeted in reaction to the news about\u00a0Salman Rushdie, the author of a blasphemous anti-Islam book, who was attacked Friday during an event in New York.\n\n\"But, isn't it odd that as we near a potential nuclear deal, the US makes claims about a hit on Bolton... and then this happens?\"\u00a0Marandi also added.\n\nSalman Rushdie has been attacked on stage during an event in New York, according to US media.\n\nAfter stabbing, Rushdie was flown to UPMC Hamot Surgery Center in Erie, Pennsylvania, and underwent surgery. Andrew Wylie, Rushdie's agent, said he was on a ventilator with a damaged liver, severed nerves in an arm and an eye he was likely to lose.\n\nMarandi's tweet comes as\u00a0the US Department of Justice issued a statement on Wednesday claiming that an Iranian citizen who is a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has been accused of attempting to assassinate John Bolton, former National Security Advisor of the United States.\n\n\"US's growing rhetoric about a politically bankrupt element, a prominent terrorist and a coup plotter against independent countries and governments, is an escape forward with the aim of escaping from responsibility for an international crime,\" Nasser Kan'ani, Iranian Foreign Ministry wrote in a tweet on Friday in reaction to the claims leveled against an alleged IRGC member by the US Department of Justice who accused him of plotting to kill former US National Security Advisor John Bolton.",

Verious state government tightened the security in veiw of the 'Bharat Bandh' call given by the armed forces aspirants.\n\nMassive demonstrations erupted last week after the Union government announced the contentious Agnipath scheme to recruit youth to serve in the three services of the Armed Forces. Taking objections over some of its conditions, the army aspirants have been agitating in 11 states including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Telangana, Odisha, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Jharkhand and Assam.\n\nThe row snowballed as demonstrations turned violent in some states. Protesters set trains on fire, vanadalised public and police vehicles, injuirng security personnel. They are demanding a roll back of the scheme -- a demand denied by the Centre.\n\nThe Centre has also been defending the scheme, explaining that recruits, or 'Agniveers', retiring after four years will be given financial aid. Also, in a nod to protesters' concerns, the government has relaxed the upper age limit from 21 to 23.",

      "text": "BEWARE SPOILERS: Just like with the previous Disney Plus series, Fantha Tracks will be offering our own episode guide for your entertainment! Here we will post every reference, Easter egg, everything named and unnamed per episode and some fun trivia in-between that we have spotted.\n\nOfficial summary: Under intense scrutiny while imprisoned,\u00a0\u00a0Cassian makes allies plan an impossible escape.\n\nIt is mentioned that Salman Paak attended a Separatist meeting Jondora. Jondora was mentioned once before in the game The Old Republic.\n\nDizon Fray, a moon in the Outer Rim from where the original recording for the torture came from, is a new planet and backstory.\n\nInside the Imperial Senate on Coruscant, it seems that the yellow Senate hovercam droids have been replaced by a new, dark metallic version.\n\nThere are also a couple of voices shouting in the background when Mon Mothma is speaking. They are not named, just numbered Senator 1 through Senator 4. The end credits do not mention them at all, making these additional voices, and most likely to be cameos. Perhaps David W. Collins was among them, as he has done so many times before.\n\nVel turns out to be a cousin of Mon Mothma. Mon Mothma\u2019s extended family never really existed before, but she had a nephew in Legends called Kell Bircher. He was a spy for her who managed to sneak into the Imperial Navy and appeared in the Star Wars (2013) comic series.\n\nVel went to Tassio Moon and brought a dress back for Leida. Tassio, and its moon, is a new location.\n\nSmall error correction: last week we said Zinska (Mensah Bediako) is a senator at Mon Mothma\u2019s rally party. Turns out that he was a prisoner on Narkina 5 who was barely glimpsed in last episode. He appears fully and better in this episode.\n\nDavo Sculdun is also new.\n\nThe Imperial masking device stolen from the naval yard in Lozash, is new and not among the earlier mentioned ones.\n\nBoth Maya Pei and Anto Kreegyr, who were mentioned last week by Saw, are now mentioned again. Wlll they turn up in future episodes?\n\nAnto Kreegyr was on his way to Kafrene. Kafrene, also named the Ring Of Kafrene, was seen in Rogue One and was the first time we saw Cassian in the movie.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s name is Rhasiv, played by Adrian Rawlins. Rawlins has had many roles in his career, but you may know him best for playing James Potter, the father of Harry, in the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nJoin us soon for our Star Wars: Andor episode 9 guide.",

      "text": "Noor Riyadh, the Saudi capital\u2019s citywide annual festival of light and art, celebrated its second edition with bigger and bolder figures, including six Guinness World Records titles. Foremost of the record titles that the event achieved is for the largest light art festival, as this year, the festival tripled in size, presenting 201 artworks by more than 130 artists, surpassing the minimum requirement of 185 installations.\n\nIn addition, Noor Riyadh 2022 welcomed 2.8 million visitors across its 40 citywide locations and five hubs, an impressive achievement that far surpasses the footfall of its inaugural edition in March 2021.\n\nThis year, the festival was held under the theme \u201cWe Dream of New Horizons,\u201d which centered around a sense of hopefulness for the future, as well as confidence in renewal and transformation. \u201cWe Dream of New Horizons\u201d was curated by Herv\u00e9 Mikaeloff, Dorothy Di Stefano, and Jumana Ghouth, along with curatorial adviser Arnaud Morand.\n\nNoor Riyadh 2022 included at least 90 new commissions from international and Saudi artists, such as Ahaad Alamoudi, Abdullah Al-Othman, Daniah Al-Saleh, Rashed Al-Shashai, Sarah Brahim, Daniel Buren, Bricklab, Douglas Gordon, Tadashi Kawamata, Alicja Kwade, Jean-Michel Othoniel, and Muhannad Shono.\n\nMarc Brickman\u2019s unforgettable aerial installations that use 1,990 drones as their medium won the Guinness title for the most drones performing an aerial dance display. The choreographed drone display, titled \u201cThe Order of Chaos: Chaos in Order,\u201d featured a swarm of drones that moved in fluid choreography over the skies of King Abdullah Park.\n\nMeanwhile, the spectacular \u201cPulse of Light\u201d by show designer Martin Arnaud is the reason behind two new records achieved: The largest laser show, in terms of area covered, and the longest distance covered by a laser light show. The nightly show, which beamed laser light across King Fahd Road, connecting the city\u2019s most recognizable skyscrapers Kingdom Tower, Faisaliah Tower and Majdoul Tower with light, reached up to 14.4 million square meters, with lasers stretching 15 kilometers in distance, more than doubling the minimum requirements in place.\n\n\u201cPulse of Light\u201d also broke two additional records, namely the largest mesh screen on a building and highest mesh screen on a building, for its installation on Kingdom Tower.\n\nPrince Badr bin Farhan Al-Saud, minister of culture, board member of the Royal Commission for Riyadh City and chairman of the Steering Committee for Riyadh Art, said: \u201cThe success of Noor Riyadh 2022 shows how visionary leadership can elevate arts and culture to new heights. Through the unwavering support of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, prime minister and chairman of the Royal Commission for Riyadh City\u2019s Board of Directors, the country\u2019s culture sector will rise to the aspirations of Vision 2030. Fulfilling Riyadh Art\u2019s aims, Noor Riyadh provides a platform for emerging and established artists to share their ideas here and beyond. To see a Saudi-created initiative break records and put the nation in the forefront of the global art scene as the largest light art festival in the world, creates a moment of pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the continued efforts of all our partners, such initiatives will cement our place within the international cultural landscape,\u201d he added.\n\nWith the citywide festival ending on Nov. 19, Noor Riyadh will continue its programming through the world-class exhibition \u201cFrom Spark to Spirit,\u201d curated by Neville Wakefield and associate curator Gaida Al-Mogren.\n\nThe exhibition traces the role of light as a signal for change, exploring themes such as the \u201cTechnologies of Light,\u201d \u201cArchitectonics of Light\u201d and \u201cConsciousness of Light.\u201d Using the \u201cLight and Space Movement\u201d from the 1960s in California \u2014 which reflected changes in the established order \u2014 as a reference point, \u201cFrom Spark to Spirit\u201d proposes how light and art can offer ways to think through the rapid cultural transformations shaping the Middle East.\n\nThe show includes works by 30 artists, including Doug Aitken, Zeinab Al-Hashemi, Zahrah Al-Ghamdi, Refik Anadol, Larry Bell, Jim Campbell, John Edmark, Phillip K. Smith III, Diana Thater, Haroon Mirza and Theories of Imagination.\n\nThe exhibition runs until Feb. 4, 2023, accompanied by a series of talks, workshops, and community engagement programs for audiences of various ages and interests.",

President Joe Biden at Al-Salam Palace in the Red Sea port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, July 15, 2022. /CFP\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (R) meets with U.S. President Joe Biden at Al-Salam Palace in the Red Sea port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, July 15, 2022. /CFP\n\nEditor's note: Zha Daojiong is a professor of International Political Economy in the School of International Studies and Institute of South-South Cooperation and Development, Peking University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.OPEC Plus announced a new target of their oil output: Reducing its quota by two million barrels per day. Implementation is set to take place in November. The oil production cut will be the first since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a drastic decrease in oil demand and per unit prices. Oil prices have recovered and fluctuated, along with shifts in the world's energy demand and supply dynamics over the past two years.In response to criticism that OPEC Plus' plan to cut oil output was a rebuke to the United States and by extension serving as a gesture of support for Russia, the group said in a statement taking note that the move was necessary to stabilize the recent drop in global energy prices. Some lawmakers in U.S. Congress plan to introduce legislation in response to the cut that would require the Joe Biden administration to remove U.S. troops and missile defense systems from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.To understand the ongoing exchange of words, it is worth noting that throughout its history, part of OPEC's operational routine is to announce alternative oil output targets: a decrease aimed at sustaining or increasing per unit sales price and an increase to hedge against reduced purchases of the commodity. Accordingly, the grouping, with association by other oil exporting countries on a voluntary basis to make it OPEC Plus, is commonly viewed to be functioning in the manner of a cartel.The extent to which oil output targets by OPEC Plus governments get enforced is difficult to track, as factors affecting change in a member economy's actual oil production are too numerous to pinpoint its agreement as the decisive cause. After all, there exists intra-member competition for the same import market of the world.\n\nA press conference after the 45th Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee and the 33rd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in Vienna, Austria, October 5, 2022. /CFP\n\nA press conference after the 45th Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee and the 33rd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in Vienna, Austria, October 5, 2022. /CFP\n\nTypically, oil importing economies adjust to announcements by OPEC Plus through a combination of measures. These include drawing from their reserves, economizing consumption and investing in alternative sources of energy. Few would count on receiving goodwill on the part of the producers or exporters.But, the most recent announcement catches particular attention, especially in the United States, against the backdrop of a complex set of geopolitical tensions. Before its war with Ukraine, Russia sold about half of 7.85 million barrels a day of crude and refined oil to Europe.But the war and the EU's vow to end its reliance on Russian oil and gas led to a geopolitical dilemma for Europe: Russia benefits from high world fossil energy prices, which in turn works against the effect of economic sanctions against it.For the United States, another major oil/gas producer and exporter in the world, it has to handle the twin struggles against macroeconomic pressures leading to inflation and joining the EU in curtailing outflow of Russia oil and gas. Additionally in November 2021, the Biden administration announced its decision to release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.In January, crude oil prices hit seven-year highs. A major cause behind the rise is the recovery of consumption by individuals, who returned to the roads as pandemic-induced restrictions were eased.Back then, OPEC Plus producers incurred ire from the United States as they had ignored calls for an increase in oil production. As a result, the U.S. coordinated actions with other countries with sizeable reserves, such as China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, in an attempt to dampen prospects of an increase in trade oil/gas prices. Actualized release is hard to track. But the spirit of political solidarity is obvious.When it comes to OPEC Plus's decision in October 2022, the Biden administration viewed itself as having an additional reason to expect positive reciprocation from Saudi Arabia, which is understood to be the most influential member of the producer group.In mid-July, Biden traveled to the Saudi Arabian port city of Jeddah and met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The meeting marked the ending of U.S. sanctions on the crown prince, over a matter related to the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.As such, what we are witnessing is a competition on the definition of security. The U.S. sees Saudi Arabia and by extension other OPEC Plus members as sharing the responsibility to treat their oil production policies as part of American definition for assuring conditions favorable to evolution of security in Europe. The oil exporting economies do not see themselves as acting in a geopolitical coalition for or against security events beyond their domestic economies.For the benefit of a stable international economy, the ideal outcome is for both sides to manage their interactions with it in mind that predictable evolutionary rather than revolutionary change remains essential.\n\nOpen in CGTN APP for better experience",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",

He just does it by himself,\u201d said Esquitin.\n\nShe said she even started reading books again.\n\nPrincipal Jason Kurtz said he wanted to challenge the students to read more. So, he asked teachers to give less homework and more time to meet reading goals.\n\nThe first semester the students read 24 million words. This semester they exceeded the goal of 30 million words.\n\n\u201cAfter reading a book, they go into a program and take that assessment test. Depending on their score depends on how many words count for that book. If they get 100 percent they 100 percent of the words for that book if they get 90 percent then 90 percent of the book 50, said Michael Licata, the assistant principal.\n\nTo celebrate the staff invited students and parents to dance and celebrate outside the school Thursday night.\n\nKurtz and Licata said they are prepared for a night with the stars.

      "text": "PARIS: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s first visit to Paris in 2018 had exposure as an objective. At the time, he as well as Emmanuel Macron were making their first steps as young leaders.\n\nMuch has happened in four years, and the world, as we have known it, has changed. The first objective of the crown prince in Paris is to highlight the changes and other reforms undergone by the Kingdom.\n\nAs pointed out by Cedomir Nestorovic, professor of geopolitics at ESSEC, the important thing to assess is whether \u201cthe massive reforms and the structural change of the Saudi society driven by the crown prince have been sufficiently noticed abroad.\u201d\n\nThe crown prince can boast today a real resume in terms of reforms.\n\nHe will be able to answer critics and face them with the positive dynamics to which Saudi Arabia has committed and underline the benefits of Arab modernity. When asked about the subject, several French legislators consider this visit to be strategically significant both for the crown prince and Macron.\n\nEnergy, according to Nestorovic, is of course the other focal point. During this period of conflict between Russia and Ukraine, gas and oil have become rare and expensive, and Europe apprehends the cold of winter.\n\nBy distancing itself from the conflict, Saudi Arabia managed, at first, to play the role of arbitrator, but the recent spectacular rapprochement between Vladimir Putin and his Turkish and Iranian counterparts reminded the Gulf monarchies that the Russian card could be a double-edged sword.\n\nAlso to be considered is the issue of Western leadership. By traveling to France, the crown prince seems to return the favor to Macron, who was the first Western head of state to visit him.\n\nIt also appears that relations have greatly improved and that France is increasingly present in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIf Macron understands the change of course initiated by the Kingdom for several years now, he will probably be in a better position than the US president to discuss energy issues.\n\nIndeed, during the meeting with Joe Biden, Saudi Arabia pledged to support the West\u2019s energy supply. But, for the time being, the real measures have not yet been taken. Similarly, the price of oil and gas has not really been addressed.\n\nMacron and the crown prince have their own cards to play, by showing that the relationship between the West and Saudi Arabia no longer necessarily passes solely through the United States.\n\nThis visit, therefore, has a strategic dimension since it deals with Europe\u2019s energy security. But it also has, as is so often the case, a political dimension. Will the two young leaders be able to understand each other better?\n\nWill we be able to say that the new French approach in Saudi Arabia is more realistic and keeps pace with the reforms and the transformation of the Kingdom?\n\nGiven the Saudi delegation accompanying the crown prince, it seems that the \u201ceconomic development\u201d aspect will be at the heart of the talks.\n\nShould contacts between economic leaders be as flourishing as expected, this will play a strong role in helping Saudi Arabia gain stature among nations as a major player.\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 saw France transform from a monarchy to a republic, which came under the control of Napoleon Bonaparte 10 years later. After he became emperor of the First French Empire from 1804-1814, his armies conquered large swaths of continental Europe.\n\nAnother monarchy emerged from the wake of Napoleon\u2019s defeat at Waterloo in 1815, and Napoleon\u2019s nephew created the Second Empire in 1852, becoming the last monarch to rule over France. He was ousted and the monarchy was replaced by the Third French Republic in 1870.\n\nThroughout the 19th\u00a0century and early 20th\u00a0century, France maintained a large colonial empire across West Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\n\nFrance sided with the Allied Powers during the Second World War, but was split in two during the conflict, with most of the country controlled by a collaborationist, pro-German government.\n\nThe country slowly recovered after the end of the war, but long wars in its colonies in Indochina (now Vietnam) and Algeria saw it ousted from these regions, and by the 1960s, most of France\u2019s former colonies had achieved independence.\n\nFrance has been a full member of the UN Security Council and NATO since the end of the Second World War, and played a vital role in the establishment of the EU.\n\nFrance has a large Muslim and Arab population owing to its former colonies in north Africa, and many of these populations suffer from social alienation and high unemployment rates.\n\nThe country has been the site of unrest and protests against the enforcement of strict secular policies and controversial bills, some of which have attempted to ban the wearing of headscarves or traditional Muslim face coverings in public.",

Althaidi, the representative of the Saudi Arabian Commercial Office in Taiwan, said in a speech that his country\u2019s \u201cSaudi Vision 2030\u201d national development plan has achieved extraordinary success under the leadership of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, per a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release. In addition to making concrete progress in environmental protection and addressing worldwide climate change issues, Saudi Arabia will actively facilitate friendly investment prospects and a welcoming environment, Althaidi said.\n\nThe governments of Taiwan and Saudi Arabia have long been committed to strengthening bilateral cooperation in various fields, and the Saudi Arabian Office in Taiwan will continue to deepen bilateral exchanges in culture, commerce, investment, and tourism, the representative said.\n\nVice Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Tah-ray Yui (\u4fde\u5927\u3d62) pointed out that Saudi Arabia is Taiwan\u2019s 15th largest trading partner, as well as Taiwan\u2019s largest crude oil supplier in the Middle East. Approximately one-third of Taiwan\u2019s crude oil imports come from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Middle Eastern country\u2019s long-term and stable energy supply is a strong foundation for Taiwan\u2019s industrial development and economic growth, Yui said. The vice minister said that Saudi Arabia included Taiwan on its initial list of countries eligible for electronic visas at the beginning of 2022.\n\nThe vice minister said he believes with the joint efforts of the Taiwanese and Saudi governments and citizens, the two countries can ensure mutual prosperity and growth and strengthen their deep bilateral friendship.\n\nThe two countries have close exchanges in the fields of economy, trade, culture, education, and agriculture, MOFA said. It noted that the Taiwan-Saudi Tax Agreement officially came into effect on Jan. 1, further enhancing bilateral relations.",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",

She said the treatment of many life-threatening diseases would be possible through non-traditional treatment of stem cells. Many Pakistanis who travel; abroad for medical treatment shall have all the facilities and treatments available right at their door step. It would also boost medical tourism in the country.\n\nThe Pakistani doctors who are seeking specialization in the stem cell treatment would now be trained by the IRM, in Pakistan. At the end of the successful training, the ABRM would issue them a certificate on the recommendation of the IRM.\n\nDr Salman Gilani hoped that after this program, Pakistan will be able to compete with other countries like India and Turkey in this field and would soon become a hub of medical tourism.\n\nHe said that various diseases including cancer, heart disease, arthritis, autism, joint pain etc. can be treated in a very safe manner through stem cell treatment. He also said that aging problems including weakness, hair fall and skin diseases could also be cured.\n\nIRM\u2019s Turkish partner, Dr. Murad Artak, shed light on the benefits of stem cells and the innovations and financial benefits of this field across the world including Pakistan.\n\nDG Legal Aid Dr. Rahim Awan, Executive Director NIH Professor Aamir Ikram, IHRA Chief Dr. Quaid Saeed, former Ambassador Naila Chauhan and former WAPDA Chairman General Muzmal Hussain also participated in the ceremony.",

The site was also used by Uthman bin Affan for the same purpose.\n\nBuilt using a wonderful architectural style, this is the second of two sites where the Prophet Muhammad performed Eid prayers during his lifetime. First caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq also prayed here during Eid, hence its name. It was built by Umar bin Abdul Aziz.\n\nLocated in Al-Musallah, this mosque was named after Umar ibn Al-Khattab, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate.\n\nThe name of this mosque came from its proximity to the Saqia well.\n\nOriginally built from basalt and located southwest of Quba Mosque, only about two meters of its walls remained before it was renovated.\n\nA well from which the Prophet Muhammad drew water. He asked that when he died, his body be washed in water from the well before burial.\n\nBuilt by Caliph Umar bin Abdul Aziz on the site where the Prophet Muhammad prayed while supervising the digging of the trench\u00a0ahead of the Battle of the (Trench).\n\nA defensive fortress built of volcanic rock, used for military protection.",

      "text": "The $20,000,000 Saudi Cup (G1) trophy stayed home in 2022 to the roar of the Riyadh crowd, as Prince Saud bin Salman Abdulaziz's Emblem Road ran down American contenders Country Grammer\u00a0 and Midnight Bourbon\u00a0 in the late stages Feb. 26 to win the world's richest race.\n\nTrained by Mitab Almulawah and ridden by Wigberto Ramos, the Kentucky-bred son of Quality Road\u00a0\u00a0 completed the 1,800 meter\u00a0(1 1/8-mile) affair in a final time of 1:50.52, besting the Bob Baffert-trained Country Grammer by a half-length, with Midnight Bourbon another 1 1/2 lengths back\u00a0in third.\n\nLongines Breeders' Cup Distaff (G1) victress Marche Lorraine\u00a0 ran admirably late to finish sixth in her career swan song, while Americans Mandaloun\u00a0\u00a0 and Art Collector\u00a0 could only manage ninth and 12th. Defending champ Mishriff\u00a0\u00a0 faltered badly to finish last of 14.\n\nThe 2021 Godolphin Mile Sponsored by Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum City-District One (G2) winner Secret Ambition\u00a0, as expected, set the early pace under Adrie de Vries, doing well to clear the field from post 12 and clip off his first quarter-mile in :24.80 (no run-up). Tracked closely by Art Collector and Mandaloun to his outside, Country Grammer behind him and Midnight Bourbon adjacent to that rival in the two-path, Secret Ambition put forth a smart half-mile in :47.86 as local hopes Making Miracles and the eventual winner ranged up four- and five-wide.\n\nEntering the turn, Mishriff was already under the whip and Mandaloun began to show warning signs. Full of horse and pouncing on the opportunity, Joel Rosario on Midnight Bourbon and Flavien Prat on Country Grammer split horses, respectively, after six furlongs in 1:12.80 and turned for home with dead aim on a tiring Secret Ambition. It became clear at this point that the American and Saudi pairs were running the best races, with the eventual victor closing the quickest. Country Grammer brushed off Midnight Bourbon with a half-furlong remaining, only to get passed in the yards by a resolute Emblem Road.\n\nBoth Ramos and Hisham Abdulwhaed, assistant trainer and stable representative, were more than over the moon. Ramos has proven a force in recent months, in particular, over the King Abdulaziz dirt.\n\n\"He wanted to go early, but I took my time with him and took a little hold and saw another horse, so then I just waited for the 500 meters to ask him,\" Ramos said. \"The key on this track is that you have to be near the front when you pass the 800 meter. If you're near, you are in a good position and outside is the best part of the track. It's a big turn, so when you put a horse who comes from behind all the way on the outside, they finish a lot better.\n\n\"I knew that I could do it, but now that I've done it, I still don't believe it. I beat so many good horses, and this is the biggest race in the world. I think he could go on to the Dubai World Cup (G1). He's the kind of horse who can do it.\"\n\nAbdulwhaed added: \"He is a great horse. He is a Quality Road, so it doesn't matter the distance\u20141,600 meters, 1,800 meters, 2,000 meters, or 2,400 meters\u2014he can do it. I can't explain with words this feeling. He trained really well and I thought that he was going better than Making Miracles. Keeping the Saudi Cup here in the Kingdom, that is the best thing and it is a great feeling. Whether it's races like Dubai World Cup or Breeders' Cup\u2014I think he is that kind of horse. He can run in those races with those good horses.\"\n\nThe victory was the seventh from nine career starts for the grandson of 2008 Sentient Jet Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint (G1) winner Ventura. Bred by Brushy Hill, he was sold for $230,000 as yearling at the 2019 Keeneland September Sale to Kinsman from the South Point Sales Agency consignment and went through the ring again as a juvenile\u00a0at the 2020 Ocala Breeders' Sales Spring Sale of 2-Year-Olds-in-Training, where he was acquired by bloodstock agent Bruno DeBerdt for $80,000 out of Wavertree's\u00a0consignment.\n\nIn his Jan. 15 start prior to the Saudi Cup, he was an impressive winner of the local King Faisal Cup over one mile. The $10,000,000 first-place prize money increased his career bankroll to $10,204,734.\n\nBob Baffert assistant Jimmy Barnes was very pleased with the effort of the runner-up, while Prat was disappointed to lose, but visibly proud of another gritty effort for Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes (G1) winner Country Grammer. Baffert confirmed via text message\u00a0that the 5-year-old is under serious consideration for the $12 million Dubai World Cup (G1) March 26.\n\n\"Off that eight-month layoff, we were ready and what a huge effort he put out,\" Barnes said. \"Congratulations to the winner. They ran a great race. Really I thought we had them turning for home. When he put away Midnight Bourbon, I said 'Oh wow, maybe we got a chance here,' but then you could see the horse coming down the outside. A first (with Pinehurst\u00a0\u00a0 in the Saudi Derby presented by Al Rajhi Bank, G3) and second today\u2014we did well.\"\n\nPrat added: \"When I pulled away, I thought I was going to win. I thought it was going to be enough and that my horse was doing the hardest, but the winner was just too good and finished harder.\"\n\nAsmussen was content with the performance of Midnight Bourbon, who placed once again in a top-class race.\n\n\"It's just wonderful to be here and to be able to compete on this level,\" Asmussen said. \"Bourbon put in another solid run. For him to carry us this far to Saudi to compete here--what a blessing.\"\n\nRosario added: \"I thought he ran really well. It was probably a little bit different with him, but he showed heart. He did great.\"\n\nFlorent Geroux was naturally a bit disheartened by the performance of Juddmonte's Mandaloun, whose Saudi-based ownership made him a considerable media focal point this week.\n\n\"He just wasn't there today,\" Geroux said. \"We knew the locals were good horses, but we thought the outside horses might be better.\"\n\nThe last-place performance of Mishriff, the defending champion and slight market favorite over Mandaloun, was the biggest surprise of all.\n\n\"He didn't jump as sharp as last time, but I did a similar thing and kept him out wide,\" jockey David Egan said. \"He got there with ease, but once I turned into the bend I was struggling from a long way out. I hope he's alright, there's obviously something amiss. He's better than that.\"",

      "text": "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (R Back), prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Dubai ruler, meets with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz (L Back) in Abu Dhabi, November 25, 2018. /Xinhua\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (R Back), prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Dubai ruler, meets with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz (L Back) in Abu Dhabi, November 25, 2018. /Xinhua\n\nEditor's note:\u00a0Hannan Hussain is an assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute and an author. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.\u00a0On September 2, Saudi Arabia announced that it would allow flights going to and from the UAE to fly over its territory \u2013 an implicit endorsement of airspace access to Israel. The move comes a day after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman engaged with U.S. presidential adviser Jared Kushner to potentially resume Israel-Palestinian \"negotiations\" \u2013 a euphemism to project Washington's appetite for Arab unity, and demonstrate Riyadh's solidarity with Palestinian statehood.Despite the Kingdom's sustained silence on the Abraham Accord, three strategic rationales suggest Riyadh will facilitate UAE-Israel rapprochement \u2013 with or without a Palestinian breakthrough.First, Abu Dhabi's position on Israeli annexation is driven by two major consistencies: the immediacy of change and level of ownership. Both remain unchanged in the aftermath of the Abraham Accord, allowing Riyadh to commit to both the Palestinian cause and the U.S.-brokered peace deal.\u00a0Abu Dhabi's endorsement of the 2002 Arab League-led Peace Initiative came with a commitment to activating necessary international contacts, and gaining support for the initiative \"at all levels.\" The language, aimed at deterring Israel's immediate support for the 1967 occupation, resurfaced again in 2005 and became a central feature of UAE's annexation posture in the aftermath of the contentious U.S. Middle East Peace Plan.Even when President Trump unveiled his \"Deal of the Century\" in January, Abu Dhabi expressed its appreciation with a cold spin: a return to broad-based negotiations and greater international ownership. Both these angles feature prominently in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh's current positions.\u00a0The UAE goes a step further and extends that historic consistency to the Abraham Accords. By claiming that all parties have agreed to stop \"further Israeli annexation\" of Palestinian territories, Abu Dhabi continues to insist it has bought time, and broadened the Israeli-U.S. binary into an international exercise.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump (R) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attend a joint press conference in the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States, January 28, 2020. /Xinhua\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump (R) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attend a joint press conference in the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States, January 28, 2020. /Xinhua\n\nThis strengthens Riyadh's view that the deal is not an obstacle, but a potential driver of direct negotiations between Palestine and Israel. Above all, the argument that Abu Dhabi betrayed the cause of the Palestinians by transforming its stance on Israeli-Palestinian peace, stands effectively challenged.Another point of convergence between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh is their fruitless campaigning against Israeli annexation. Both leaderships point to Palestine's pursuit for independence, but employ instruments of engagement that are largely rhetorical.Abu Dhabi appears confident that there will be no Israeli annexations for a long time, but has shown no signs of extracting a timeline for Israel's suspension of West Bank annexation. It claims support for Palestinian statehood, but has conditioned success on cyber security, tourism, technology and trade investments.Days after government officials declared Netanyahu's annexation shift as the trigger to the deal, UAE's foreign minister went on record to confirm the motivations were purely political. There is simply no case on Israeli-Palestinian peace.The same thread runs through Riyadh's reactionary campaigning. It has repeatedly condemned Israel's plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, pointing to efforts that should \"advance negotiations in accordance with international laws\" and reach a \"just and comprehensive solution\" to meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people.However, it is Riyadh that has struggled to present viable alternatives to Washington's deals of the century, given the Trump administration's demonstrated leverage over the crown prince, and his prospects to wield the throne.More importantly, Riyadh has been less willing to champion communication lines between Palestine, Israel and allies in the absence of U.S. brinkmanship, raising questions about its newfound autonomy on the Abraham Accord.Furthermore, a range of demographic and economic exigencies have swept Gulf States in recent months \u2013 all denied critical scrutiny under the Kingdom's watch. Employment frustrations and revenue concerns have forced states to focus solidarity inwards \u2013 away from Palestine and with the masses.The Abraham Accord is a direct reflection of polarizing Gulf attitudes towards Palestine. Riyadh's stated support for the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative does nothing to plug or overcome these divides.Taken together, the Kingdom is correct to refuse outright support for UAE-Israel normalization, focusing its rhetoric on Palestinian renegotiation \u2013 a cornerstone of Riyadh's Israel policy.But Riyadh is wrong to believe that Palestinians would buy that rationale forever, especially when the deals concerning their future are negotiated and legitimized from the sidelines.",

      "text": "When Donald Trump touched down in Saudi Arabia in 2017, King Salman was waiting on the tarmac.\n\nIt was the president's first overseas trip and the capital Riyadh had been transformed into a celebration of American culture, with flags, projections and music.\n\nJoe Biden's arrival could not have been more different. Awaiting him as he walked down the steps of Air Force One was the governor of Mecca.\n\nLater, the president greeted the country's de-facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) with a fist bump. This COVID precaution helpfully avoided a handshake photo-op, something White House aides are said to have dreaded.\n\nNaturally the Saudis have adapted their welcome and tailored their diplomatic choreography to a more traditional politician. But the contrast is also evidence of strained relations between the two nations as Mr Biden attempts a tricky pivot from distrusting the kingdom to having to rely on it.\n\nDuring the 2020 election campaign, candidate Biden said he would make the country a \"pariah\" due to its human rights abuses. The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in 2018 is perhaps the most high-profile example.\n\nSo, the fist bumping did not go down well with the Washington Post who branded it \"shameful\".\n\nThe paper, for whom Mr Khashoggi was a contributor, said in a statement: \"[It] was worse than a handshake - it was shameful.\n\n\"It projected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to MBS the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking.\"\n\nThe problem is, the president has realised he needs Saudi Arabia: to help counter the threat of China, increase oil production, and improve relations with Israel. Today it made for an awkward meeting.\n\nAnalysis: Biden visits Middle East for first time as president but the timing is hardly ideal\n\n\"Will you apologise to [Jamal Khashoggi's] family?\" shouted an American journalist as the two leaders sat down at the start of talks. The crown prince seemed to slightly smirk as a Saudi aide grabbed the arm of the reporter.\n\nThere is no independent media in Saudi Arabia. Local journalists live under heavy surveillance and some have been imprisoned.\n\nEarlier, President Biden had met with the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank. The US has been trying to mend relations with the Palestinians since Donald Trump's administration cut aid and pushed relations to a nadir.\n\nThe former president had thrown his full support behind then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline agenda, giving the go-ahead for Jewish settlement expansion and recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nAnd in Palestine on Friday, Mr Biden's efforts fell on many deaf ears. While they heard his promises, many didn't fully buy them.\n\nThe diplomatic history of the US is full of necessary - if unconventional - bonds between leaders.\n\nMr Biden may be finding his trip to Saudi Arabia a tense encounter, but more than any president, he knows the importance of the long game.",

      "text": "SAUDI ARABIA: Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been named the kingdom\u2019s prime minister in a Cabinet reshuffle ordered by King Salman, according to a royal decree published by the official Saudi Press Agency on Tuesday.\n\nPrince Mohammed is already de facto ruler of the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, and the appointment formalises his role as leader of the kingdom\u2019s government.\n\nThe crown prince, known by his initials MBS, previously served as deputy prime minister as well as defence minister. He is being replaced as Defence Minister by his younger brother, Khalid bin Salman, who was deputy Defence Minister.\n\nBy appointing MBS as Prime Minister, a role previously \u2013 and typically \u2013 held by the king, the 86-year-old monarch continues a slow but steady transfer of power in the kingdom. The 37-year-old crown prince was already in charge of many of the kingdom\u2019s major portfolios, including the economy, defence, oil, and internal security.\n\nIn April 2016, Prince Mohammed introduced Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia\u2019s vision of the future, which is aimed at making the kingdom the heart of the Arab and Islamic world, an investment powerhouse, and a hub that connects three continents.\n\nThe initiative seeks to diversify and privatise the economy, and to make it less reliant on oil. By 2030, the initiative also aims to establish an e-government system. MBS became heir to the throne in 2017, after he previously held the position of defence minister. - ALJAZEERA",

The actor made the comments at a virtual launch event for Deanne Pandey\u2019s new wellness book.\n\nIn an interview, Salman said that most of his friends he has known for many decades, and those are the people he shares the strongest bond with. He has made new friends in recent years, but the equation is rarely as strong.\n\nAsked if he\u2019s a good judge of character, the actor told NDTV, \u201cI take a lot of time in becoming friends, so all the friends that I\u2019ve had have been 20-30 years old. And all the new people who keep coming in, they\u2019re there, but they\u2019re not as close as the four-five friends that I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cSo when you get to know... First everyone\u2019s really cool, and then you get to know each other\u2019s faults. If you\u2019re okay with their faults then you\u2019re fine. Because their qualities are a thousand times more than what they\u2019re weakness are. If you\u2019re okay with the weaknesses, you\u2019re okay with them, but if you\u2019re not okay with the weaknesses, and some friends aren\u2019t as strong, then you don\u2019t need that relationship.\u201d\n\nHe said that eventually, people go their own ways, and while it is understandable to be bothered by this, after a point it\u2019s \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019.\n\nAlso read: Neha Kakkar tells Salman Khan her love story with Rohanpreet Singh, says \u2018I am his deewani, I had to marry him\u2019\n\nHe also spoke about the difference between anger and temper. He said, \u201cI have anger, which is needed. Anger is not bad, if you want to take a stand you should have anger. I don\u2019t have a temper and that\u2019s not good. We get upset about small things like if someone is late, or if the shoot didn\u2019t start on time. I tell people, look around and see how privileged we are, we should just be grateful for what all we have.\u201d\n\nSalman last appeared in Bharat. He will be seen in Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai next. The actor is currently hosting the 14th season of Bigg Boss.",

The French presence in the Kingdom is marked by a network of schools in Riyadh, Jeddah and Alkhobar, making education one of the primary elements on which the two nations collaborate.\n\nAs part of its Vision 2030, the Kingdom has initiated large-scale events enabling its development as a culture, education, tourism and sports hub on an international level. These events include Riyadh Season, Jeddah Season, AlUla Season, the Red Sea International Film Festival, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale and the upcoming Islamic Arts Biennale in Jeddah.\n\n\u201cWe are all very lucky to live in a thrilling context in which Saudi Arabia is rapidly opening up and exploring new directions for its future. The Kingdom is now witnessing what President (Emmanuel) Macron called a \u2018cultural revolution\u2019 during his visit to Jeddah,\u201d said the ambassador.\n\nThe new French Cultural Season in Saudi Arabia is a promising one, with events starting in October with the celebration of the 20th anniversary of French-Saudi cooperation in the field of archaeology. The event is a two-day symposium that will see the participation of the 15 French archaeological missions collaborating with Saudi archaeologists across the Kingdom in the Farasan Islands, Hegra and AlUla, among other locations.\n\nThe second event in the pipeline is \u201cDigital November,\u201d which is aimed at bringing art and technology together. A series of tournaments, workshops and other activities centered on esports and e-games will be featured.\n\nOther cultural cooperation projects will involve music, cinema, fashion, design and poetry, with the annual Night of Poetry to be held in December.\n\nFranco-Saudi cooperation is also evident through the Kingdom\u2019s giga-projects \u2014 such as the development of AlUla \u2014 that will shape the country for decades to follow.\n\nAfAlula, the French Agency for the Development of AlUla, is collaborating with the Royal Commission for AlUla to develop the region \u201cbased on an intergovernmental agreement signed in April 2018 during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s visit to Paris,\u201d Pouille said.\n\nThe AlUla project is the first of a series of initiatives that aim to reinforce the ties between the two countries.\n\nSince the French president\u2019s visit to Jeddah in December 2021, several agreements have been signed, including one for Villa Hegra, an ambitious institution of contemporary art that will enable the Kingdom to build a creative and artistic hub, the first of its kind in the Middle East.\n\nThe agreements signal the \u201cbeginning of a new era of cooperation between France and Saudi Arabia,\u201d according to the ambassador.",

      "text": "The Islamic State and Saudi Arabia \u201cbelieve in an intolerant version of Islam,\u201d but the critical difference between the two is that the kingdom is a pragmatic state, the author of a recent essay on the Saudi interior minister said Wednesday.\n\nBruce Riedel, speaking at the Brookings Institution, where he is a senior fellow, said Crown Prince Muhammed bin Nayef, who was educated in Oregon and trained by the FBI in counterterrorism techniques, \u201cis instinctively pro-American.\u201d He is part of the generational shift in leadership in Saudi Arabia. His rival for the throne in the future is the current minister of defense, Prince Muhammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.\n\nBin Salman is the architect of the Saudi-led Sunni Arab coalition trying to oust the Shiite Houthis from control of Yemen, but in Ridel\u2019s words it is a stalemated conflict that is producing a humanitarian crisis in the country of 25 million. Bin Nayef put down an al Qaeda-led insurgency in the kingdom in 2006 but it has shown renewed strength in Yemen and parts of Saudi Arabia.\n\nWilliam McCants, who wrote a companion essay on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi for the Washington think-tank, described him as \u201cuniquely capable leader\u201d who \u201cwould be very difficult to replace\u201d if killed. Al Baghdadi has religious stature as scholar of the Koran, his claim of descent from the Prophet Mohammed\u2014which he used to proclaim himself caliph\u2014and his considerable skills at negotiation between jihadis and Ba\u2019athists who had served in Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime in establishing the Islamic State.\n\nMcCants said al Baghdadi had become radicalized before he was held in 2004 by the Americans after the Iraq invasion. What sets him apart from other Islamic extremists is his wanting \u201cto impose his vision on the Muslims around him . . . by force if necessary.\u201d\n\nBoth bin Nayef and al Baghdadi \u201care at the top of a Muslim state,\u201d but al Baghdadi, claiming to be the commander of believers as caliph \u201cseeks to expand [the Islamic State] beyond its borders.\u201d McCants said 8 million people live under its control in large sections of Syria and Iraq.\n\nWhen asked what fuels the growth of the Islamic State, McCants said it is a \u201cbelief that the Sunni world is under attack.\u201d\n\nGoing after al Baghdadi \u201cis not enough, but about all we can do,\u201d he added. The center of gravity in topping the Islamic State is the Sunni Arab tribes who remain on the sidelines in this campaign.\n\nIn the Syria civil war, Riedel said at the start the Saudis were willing to fight [Bashar al] Assad, whose regime is backed by Russia, Iran and Iranian-supported Hezbollah. Iran and Hezbollah are Shiite, who make up about 10 percent of the Muslim world. Now with Moscow playing a larger role in the fighting, Saudi clerics are saying it is time to teach Russia a lesson they will never forget, one stronger than its defeat in Afghanistan that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of global jihad, he said.\n\nIncreasingly since 1979, the Iranians and Saudis \u201chave turned [Middle East turmoil] into a zero sum game\u201d that the United States can do little about, Riedel added. \u201cFanning the flames of sectarianism is not good for the kingdom, for the United States\u201d and even worse for the Russians.",

That would increase participation in the domestic product seven times on current levels, and jobs 12 times by 2030,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the opening ceremony, Mohammed Islam, host of \u201cThe Mo Show\u201d podcast, discussed ways to make an income from digital content with guests Chirag Desai, founder of Amaeya Media, Hadeel Al-Eisa, Ithra\u2019s director of communication and content production, and James Cridland, editor of Podnews.\n\nIslam, whose English podcast offers an insight into daily life in Saudi Arabia, questioned if the relatively low cost of setting up podcasts could pose a competition threat to mainstream media organizations.\n\nCridland said: \u201cI think big corporations already know this, such as the BBC, and they are losing some of their real talents as they go to a podcast where they can be freer and less regulated, allowing them to do more.\u201d\n\nHe noted that there were more than 4 million different podcasts around the world. \u201cIt is up to you as a consumer to decide if this content is right for you,\u201d he added.\n\nDesai said: \u201cIf you want to be a podcaster, there are two things that matter: The purpose of why you are doing it, and then having a plan, because many podcasts fail because the plan wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nIslam pointed out that 200,000 of the 4 million podcasts had only managed a maximum six episodes because their creators had either not been consistent or failed to introduce new material.\n\nAl-Eisa said the main focus of many podcasters was on going viral.\n\n\u201cSometimes they wouldn\u2019t consider their content, especially some new young content providers; they focus on going viral and becoming a trend which kills all of it, and I think people should focus on the purpose.\u201d\n\nWith the goal of helping to make Saudi Arabia one of the leading digital nations by 2030, the Ignite executive program hosts intergenerational conversations in a bid to remove barriers and open new avenues for knowledge sharing and information exchange.",

      "text": "Boris Johnson is poised to travel to Saudi Arabia next week for talks on oil as he attempts to move the UK away from dependence on energy supplies from Russia.\n\nAlthough Downing Street insists the trip is not finalised or confirmed, the prime minister is facing calls from Tory MPs to intervene to urge the Saudis to release more oil.\n\nThe potential trip has emerged as fuel prices at the pumps have reached record levels, topping \u00a31.60 a litre for petrol and \u00a31.70 for diesel, according to the RAC's latest figures.\n\nPutin 'not ready to end war' after talks with France and Germany - latest updates\n\nGovernment insiders claim the prime minister has better links with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman than any other G7 leader and that the pair have exchanged WhatsApp messages.\n\nIn contrast, it has been reported that the prince refused to take a call from President Biden, who has denounced Saudi Arabia as a \"pariah\" over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\n\nMr Johnson's potential trip comes as Saudi Arabia announced that it executed 81 men, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian, for terrorism and other offences including holding \"deviant beliefs\" in the biggest mass execution in decades.\n\nThe Saudi interior ministry said: \"These individuals, totalling 81, were convicted of various crimes including murdering innocent men, women and children.\n\n\"Crimes committed by these individuals also include pledging allegiance to foreign terrorist organisations, such as ISIS, al-Qaeda and the Houthis.\"\n\nThe last time the kingdom carried out an execution of a similar scale was in 1980 when 63 people were killed in one day, a year after militants seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca, according to state media reports.\n\nOn the prime minister's plans to travel to Saudi Arabia for a meeting with the prince, The Times reported: \"The trip has not been finalised, but is looking increasingly likely.\"\n\nA No 10 spokesperson told Sky News: \"Nothing is planned at the moment. We will update in the usual way if anything is confirmed.\"\n\nIn his interview with Beth Rigby on Sky News on Thursday, Mr Johnson said: \"What we are going to do is look at our energy supply\u2026 to move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas.\n\n\"We are now going to do the dramatic steps that we need to take to have independent energy supply, so that we're no longer capable of being blackmailed by Putin.\"\n\nClaiming Mr Johnson is well placed to persuade the Saudis to pump more oil, government insiders point to his praise for the prince's reform agenda when he was foreign secretary.\n\nAnd controversially, unlike the United States, the UK has continued to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, defying critics who protested that the weapons were being used in the war on Yemen.\n\nThe prime minister's allies also point out that in a highly significant coup he persuaded the Saudis to commit to net zero by 2060 ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow last year.\n\nMr Johnson has been due to visit Saudi Arabia twice in recent years, most recently last month on a trip postponed because of the Ukraine crisis. A phone call was held instead.\n\nAnd senior Conservative MPs believe that after the Saudis' phone call snub to President Biden, Mr Johnson could broker an oil deal which could be crucial to easing the energy crisis.\n\nEx-minister Steve Baker, a leading figure in the Tories' Net Zero Scrutiny Group, told The Daily Telegraph this week: \"Boris has come into his own during this crisis.\n\n\"Now would be just the moment for him to help deliver more flows of oil and gas from Saudi Arabia so we can shut down Putin's war machine sooner.\"\n\nFormer Middle East minister Andrew Murrison said: \"The UK has always maintained a positive and constructive relationship with Saudi based on dialogue. I'm sure that will be useful in the current context.\"",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",

      "text": "LONDON: Eddie Howe has refused to be drawn on whether Newcastle United are in a title race despite bloodying the noses of top-of-the-table Arsenal.\n\nThe Magpies kept their sixth clean sheet in succession, making it nearly nine hours of football since they conceded a goal \u2014 back on Nov. 6, 2021 \u2014 which is even more incredible because Premier League leaders Arsenal had scored in all 16 games of this campaign.\n\nUnited frustrated the Gunners, who could have stretched 10 points clear at the top with a win, but also didn\u2019t produce their best performance, according to Howe.\n\nThese latest heroics have led many to continue to talk Newcastle up as possible title contenders, especially having only lost once, and continuing to have the best defense in the league. Howe, though, is still refusing to go there.\n\nSpeaking from the Emirates, the head coach said: \u201cThere is no race from our perspective. It is just about being the best team that we can be on a continued basis.\n\n\u201cWe need to improve, we are working hard every day to do that with the players that we have. That is our main goal.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to attack the game, we wanted to be ourselves. I don\u2019t think we quite were \u2014 but I think that is credit to Arsenal. They forced us to play a little deeper than we normally do.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to do that in these games, you have to slightly tweak the way you play to stay in the match. We did that and I think the players deserve lots of credit for coming through that test.\n\n\u201cThe next step for us is to have some more quality. There were some loose passes and touches that broke those attacks down.\n\n\u201cWe are looking to evolve and improve all parts of our game.\u201d\n\nHowe made just one change to the United side, with Callum Wilson restored to the frontline in place of Chris Wood who started the game on the back foot.\n\nWhile Newcastle had not conceded in the five games prior to the trip to the Emirates, they were cut open at will by a rampant Arsenal side in the opening exchanges.\n\nAfter some penalty box pinball the ball fell to the man you\u2019d least like it to in Martin Odegaard, however the in-form Norwegian volleyed over the top of Nick Pope\u2019s bar. Pope then had to be sharp to deny Bukayo Saka\u2019s cross-goal effort with his outstretched right leg.\n\nAt the other end, Wilson mustered the Magpies\u2019 first effort on goal but England teammate Aaron Ramsdale was more than equal to it.\n\nUnited got to grips with the pace of the game as the half wore on but were still caused all kinds of problems by the speed of Saka down the Newcastle left and movement of the likes of Eddie Nketiah, Odegaard and others through the middle.\n\nHowever, their resolute defense \u2014 the best in the Premier League this season \u2014 held firm to go in at the break level, although Joelinton should have put them in front from just over five meters after a Kieran Trippier corner was flicked on by Fabian Schar, only for the Brazilian to somehow head over with the goal at his mercy.\n\nWhile the first 45 saw United show a limited version of themselves, more keen to keep Arsenal at bay, they came out with renewed vigor, showing greater belief in the final third.\n\nThat bravery was almost rewarded when Joelinton closed down Ramsdale in typical fashion, forcing the keeper into an error and while the ball wouldn\u2019t fall kindly for a Miguel Almiron or Sean Longstaff effort, the Paraguayan recycled and pulled back for Wilson, who couldn\u2019t quite connect with a fizzing cross.\n\nAs was to be expected, momentum then switched in favor of the hosts as Saka again enjoyed some success down the Arsenal right, despite Joelinton doubling up on the England winger to help struggling Dan Burn out.\n\nPressure continued to build without any real chances being created until Gabriel Martinelli rose highest at the front post to flick wide with Pope stranded.\n\nAgain Pope had to be at his usual sharp best to deny Nketiah a late winner as the ball deflected through into his path but his low finish was turned away by the keeper.\n\nArsenal had a penalty call turned down in the final minute of added time when the ball hit Jacob Murphy\u2019s arm, but was not deemed to be an infringement. \u201cAt that stage of the game you are just thinking \u2018please no, the lads have given so much to the game.\u2019 That would\u2019ve been a travesty for us,\u201d Howe said of the late penalty shout.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a penalty, just because of the proximity. But you just never know.\u201d That incident enraged Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, which saw Howe uncharacteristically clash with the Spaniard on the touchline.\n\nOn the Arteta incident, he added with a smile: \u201cWith me and Mikel, yeah it was fine.\u201d\n\nWhile this stands out as probably United\u2019s best result of the campaign, Howe still sees room for improvement \u2014 and what better way to do that than dive into the January transfer market.\n\nSpeaking about possible additions, Howe said: \u201cAt the moment we are taking it day-by-day. We have got a strong team and a strong group of players who are giving everything. But we will assess what we need as we go through. January is a long month.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly no intention to imminently improve the squad, but that could change.\u201d\n\nOn the return of Dubravka and the absence of stand-in Loris Karius, Howe said: \u201cMartin\u2019s situation is that he wanted to come back, and we were delighted to welcome him back.\n\n\u201cThere was never an issue between me and Martin. He\u2019s a top goalkeeper, and I\u2019m delighted to welcome him back to the squad.\u201d\n\nOn ex-Liverpool keeper Karius, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s no update on Loris.\u201d",

      "text": "RIYADH: The Saudi Culinary Arts Commission is hosting a pavilion at the Terra Madre Network conference in Turin, Italy, to showcase some of the Kingdom\u2019s unique dishes and indigenous foods.\n\nThe commission said on Tuesday: \u201cAt the conference, 13 elements of Saudi cuisine were added to the Ark of Taste Archives, an international catalogue of endangered heritage foods managed by the Slow Food movement.\n\n\u201cThis follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Culinary Arts Commission and Slow Food to support the Kingdom\u2019s burgeoning culinary sector, including the involvement of Saudi farmers\u2019 markets in the Global Slow Food Earth Market list, and the identification of further opportunities for cooperation.\u201d\n\nSlow Food is a global movement that operates in over 160 countries to preserve and increase awareness of endangered foods that are unique in taste and native to a certain region.\n\nSome of the Saudi foods that were listed in the Ark of Taste include hassawi rice, native to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province and considered one of the most expensive types of rice, and samh seeds, native to Al-Jouf Province.\n\nThe list also includes the distinct white desert truffles of the Northern Region called Al-Kamaa, khawlani coffee beans from Jazan Region \u2014 among the finest in the world \u2014 and Al-Maghmi dates, a traditional Saudi dish made with molasses and sesame seeds.\n\nRegistering these foods comes as part of the commission\u2019s efforts to preserve the historical legacy of culinary arts in the Kingdom and encourage the public to protect them from extinction.\n\nCommenting on the participation, Mayada Badr, CEO of the Culinary Arts Commission, said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s attendance at this event is a culmination of the work by dedicated producers around the Kingdom to elevate our culinary sector. We are delighted to showcase the best of Saudi cuisine at Terra Madre, and we hope audiences will enjoy sampling some of our unique and delicious dishes.\u201d\n\nThe conference also saw the Aseer region in Saudi Arabia formally awarded the title of World Region of Gastronomy 2024 by the International Institute of Gastronomy, Culture, Arts, and Tourism.\n\nThe international jury of IGCAT experts recognized the welcoming spirit of the Aseer community and their willingness to showcase and share their food and culture.\n\nThe jury commented: \u201cThe light of the Middle East shines from the region of Aseer. A lot of work has been done to empower the community and prepare them for welcoming future visitors to their unique culture. The culinary scene of Aseer is rooted in tradition and it has the potential to become a culinary destination and contribute to the creative economy.\u201d\n\nOn the award for the Aseer region, Badr said: \u201cSaudi Arabia has a diverse culture and a rich heritage, and we are proud that the Aseer region has been formally awarded World Region of Gastronomy 2024, in recognition of their efforts to preserve the region's diverse and distinctive food culture while protecting the environment and empowering younger generations.\u201d\n\nSaudi chef Hatoon Altoukhi, touted as one of the best authentic Italian food chefs on social media, told Arab News: \u201cWe have reached a great milestone towards our (Vision) 2030 goals. The Saudi region of Aseer is awarded World Region of Gastronomy in Italy, where the Italians respect and give much more attention to the food industry.\n\n\u201cBeing a Saudi chef who specializes in Italian cuisine and (who) married into an Italian family, I immediately shared the news with our family in Italy and felt so much pride that we are now en route to greatness and international gastronomy recognition,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kingdom\u2019s participation at Terra Madre is part of broader efforts to stimulate cultural exchange and dialogue with counterparts worldwide while introducing Saudi Arabia\u2019s diverse culinary heritage and native agricultural crops to the world.\n\nTerra Madre is a network of food communities that holds a major conference every two years in Turin to foster discussion and present innovative concepts on food, globalization, and economics.\n\nThe conference aims to connect producers from across the food supply chain to encourage collaboration and improve their skills for a more developed global food system.",

      "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo's surprise move to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr is not one born of a desire to win more silverware, it's down to money...piles and piles of the stuff.\n\nRonaldo\u00a0was already sitting on a healthy chunk of change following a stellar career at Real Madrid, Juventus and Manchester United.\n\nHe was already in the big leagues when it came to richest footballer, but now he's taking a swing at the world's highest-paid athlete too.\n\nRonaldo is now reportedly earning $75million-a-year at the Saudi club, and that's without all the added extras which will probably see that figure double.\n\nRonaldo's new contract dwarfs the contract extension Kylian Mbappe signed with Paris Saint-Germain in 2022 which landed the French World Cup star a basic salary of $63million-a-year.\n\nRonaldo (\u20ac16million) leaps ahead of\u00a0Mbappe\u00a0(\u20ac7million), Neymar (\u20ac4million) when it comes to monthly salary (without bonuses), while Lionel Messi is scraping by on \u20ac3.375million.\n\nBut how do these astronomical figures relate to the rest of the footballing world?\n\nWho is the world's richest player? The answer might surprise you.\n\nA Barcelona and Spain legend, Iniesta has won everything there is to be won for club and country, which included a four-year period in which Spain won a World Cup and two European Championships.\n\nIniesta is still playing in Japan for Vissel Kobe where a yearly salary of around $30million puts him among the highest earning footballers in the world.\n\nA footballing icon who got fans from around the world off their seats when representing his country and clubs such as Barcelona and AC Milan.\n\nA face of Nike adverts, his commercial from the mid 2000s where he puts his boots on, juggles the ball to the edge of the box and then hits the crossbar five times was the stuff of legends. And a nod to just how good video-editing had become.\n\nAn Ivorian and Chelsea legend, striker Drogba remains one of the best finishers to grace the Premier League.\n\nHis list of honours include four Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups and last but not least, a Champions League winners medal, in which he scored the goal to take the match to extra time before converting the match-winning penalty.\n\nDrogba scored 65 times for his country and almost bagged 300 times at club level in a career that took in lucrative spells in China and Turkey and ended at the age of 40 at USL side Phoenix Rising.\n\nFrom one of the greatest African players of all time to another. Eto'o, also a striker, is best remembered for his time at Barcelona, where he struck 130 times between 2004 and 2009.\n\nEto'o won Olympic gold and the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon in 2000 and the AFCON again two years later, the Copa del Rey with Mallorca in 2003, eight major honours at Barcelona and another five at Inter Milan.\n\nHis former clubs also included Qatar SC, Turkish teams Antalyaspor and Konyaspor and Russian outfit Anzhi Makhachkala, earning him some huge paydays in the twilight of his career.\n\nEto'o is now president of the Cameroon football federation, and made the headlines again at the 2022 World Cup after a \"violent altercation\" with a 'fan' with a video camera. He apologised to the public for his part in the incident.\n\nBrazilian Kaka was an attacking midfielder who possessed incredible ability on the ball, lighting up many a game.\n\nA former AC Milan and Real Madrid player, Kaka won pretty much all there was to be won, including the World Cup in 2002 with Brazil and the 2007 Ballon d'Or.\n\nLucrative spells at Milan, Madrid and latterly with Orlando City in MLS mean the Brazilian has plenty of money to spend on his two passions, real estate and cars.\n\nA one-club man (barring a loan spell with Stuttgart), the former Bayern Munich defender played over 700 times for club and country.\n\nHis 113 caps for Germany puts him in the top 10 for his nation and he captained his country to World Cup glory in 2014 before announcing his retirement from international football days later.\n\nHe won 21 honours for Bayern, including eight Bundesliga titles and was never sent off once.\n\nA book deal, endorsements and huge annual contract at Bayern account for most of his wealth.\n\nOne of the greatest footballers, if not the greatest footballer of all time, Pele retired before many of the players on the list were even born.\n\nHe won three World Cups with Brazil in 1958, 1962 and 1970 and scored 1,283 goals in his career (although 526 of those came in unofficial and tour matches).\n\nAnd while Pele was not able to generate huge wealth during his career despite a lucrative spell with New York Cosmos in the North American Soccer League, he traded off his name since, building up a sizable sum advertising everything from Mastercard to erectile dysfunction aids.\n\nPele passed away in December 2022 but his legend will live on forever.\n\nThe Real Madrid winger is best known for his spell with Chelsea which saw him win the PFA and Premier League Player of the Season award in 2014/15.\n\nHe has won the league in France, England and in Spain and was the captain of Belgium, for whom he has appeared over 100 times since making his debut in 2008.\n\nHe hasn't hit heights at the Bernabeu but nevertheless has been able to take his net worth to $100million thanks to a huge contract and endorsements.\n\nThe 'King of Rome' joins our list despite playing for one club for his entire career.\n\nAt club level Totti only won the Serie A once and two Coppa Italias, so he's not high on the list when it comes to silverware compared to others. Although he does have a World Cup in his pocket, so one ahead of Ronaldo there.\n\nThe Italian equivalent of David Beckham is a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF and spends a lot of his time working for charity. As a player he had many endorsement deals including Nike, Pepsi, Fiat, EA Sports and several modelling deals.\n\nHowever, an ongoing acrimonious divorce with tv presenter wife Ilary Blasi in 2022 won't help his bank account.\n\nA superstar at Spurs before becoming a Galactico at Real Madrid, Bale\u00a0was reportedly on an annual wage of around $30million while in Spain.\n\nSo it was a big surprise when he took a huge pay cut to join LAFC in the MLS, coining in a mere \u00a3100,000 a week. Which is peanuts compared to the rest of this list.\n\nHe has made a lot of his loot from endorsements deals with several companies in his career including Adidas, EA Sports, Lucozade and BT Sport. Plus he draws in a tidy sum making sponsored posts to his 50million Instagram followers.\n\nHis enormous wealth means he will easily be able to fund a transition to his main love, golf, once his playing career is over.\n\nStill the leading scorer for England and Manchester United with 51 and 253 goals, respectively, the DC United head coach is reported to have a net worth of $145million.\n\nContracts, including a lucrative spell in MLS, endorsements and image rights account for his huge wealth.\n\nWhilst manager of\u00a0cash-strapped Derby County, he deferred his wages to allow the players to be paid.\n\nFormer Brazilian wonderkid Alexandre Pato is the first name in the top 10, even though he has not quite lived up to the hype that accompanied his breakthrough at Internacional in 2006.\n\nStill only in his early 30s, Pato's career has taken him to Italian giants AC Milan, Sao Paulo (loan), Corinthians, Chelsea (loan), Villarreal, Chinese club Tianjin, back to Sao Paulo and then on to the MLS with Orlando City.\n\nThe majority of Pato's net worth comes from savvy investments, sizable property holdings and lucrative endorsement deals with CoverGirl cosmetics.\n\nThe 33-year-old also owns a chain of burger restaurants in Brasilia, a vodka brand and a fashion line.\n\nMbappe signed a contract extension in May 2022, which reportedly will him take home\u00a0\u20ac630m in gross salary over the three-year deal.\n\nHe will also collect a\u00a0\u20ac180m signing on bonus, which he'll get even if he leaves before 2025. Oh and don't forget his\u00a0\u20ac69m\u00a0loyalty bonus.\n\nHis healthy net worth includes deals with Nike, EA Sports and Hublot, but expect that to increase as he now has much greater power over his images rights.\n\nThe original Ronaldo, or R9 as he is now called, was one of the best finishers the world has ever seen. He hit 295 goals in a club career that took in Inter and AC Milan plus Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nScored 62 for Brazil with whom he also won the World Cup and has gone on to forge a successful career in business.\n\nThe majority shareholder in Real Valladolid, he also owns Brazilian side Cruzeiro.\n\nClosing in on 600 club goals after a career which has taken in AC Milan, Manchester United, Barcelona, PSG and LA Galaxy and seen him win more than 30 trophies.\n\nEven at the age of 41, Zlatan is still performing at the top level with AC Milan in Serie A.\n\nMassive salaries, a hugely successful autobiography and never-ending endorsements have seen Zlatan amass a fortune to rival his ego.\n\nAlthough impossible to predict his exact net worth, Neymar takes his spot at number seven. A worldwide superstar, the PSG winger has won almost everything there is to be won at club level, apart from the Champions League.\n\nInstantly recognisable around the world, he was made the world's highest paid player when moving to Paris.\n\nAdd in endorsements, massive sportswear deals with Nike and then Puma and two film appearances and it all adds up to seventh place on our list.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. How can Dave Whelan be above Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a list of footballers' net worth?\n\nWell, the former Wigan Athletic owner was a full-back with Blackburn and Crewe before making his fortune with JJB Sports.\n\nA leg break in the FA Cup final helped his transition to the retail business and he already had a market stall before he hung up his boots before the age of 30.\n\nHe bought Wigan Athletic in 1995 and helped them rise from Division Three to the Premier League, winning the FA Cup in 2013.\n\nWorld Cup winner Messi has lit up the game since making his professional debut in 2004 and claimed almost 1,000 goal contributions at Barcelona before moving to PSG in the summer of 2021.\n\nA dazzling dribbler, Messi is considered to be the greatest player of all time. However, in this particular list he finds himself behind GOAT rival Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nHis contract at PSG being worth a reported \u20ac3.375million a month, plus he's also got his long-term deals with Adidas, Pepsi, MasterCard and Budweiser.\n\nNow with a World Cup under his belt, Messi has probably reached the pinnacle of his career on the pitch, while off it life isn't too shabby either.\n\nA worldwide superstar, the Inter Miami co-owner came through the Manchester United academy with the Class of 92, was a Galactico at Real Madrid and also played for AC Milan, LA Galaxy and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nHis marriage to Victoria 'Posh Spice' Beckham helped him become a fashion icon and he continues to be in demand long after his retirement from playing.\n\nHis endorsements include H&M, Tudor, Haig Whiskey, Armani, Breitling and he was was reportedly paid \u00a310million to be an ambassador for the Qatar World Cup.\n\nA brand first and a player second, CR7 can't be far off becoming a billionaire.\n\nWith an Instagram following of 527million,\u00a0Ronaldo can attract huge sums for his endorsements. Arguably he is now more valuable commodity to corporate business than he is to football managers. Just ask Erik ten Hag.\n\nHis departure from Manchester United before the 2022 World Cup left a sour taste in the mouth, and his dream of lifting the famous trophy in Qatar also ended in tears.\n\nAs a free agent the world was seemingly his oyster, but after the Manchester United debacle other European teams steered cleared of the five-times Ballon d'Or winner.\n\nIn December 2022, Saudi club Al-Nassr opened their wallet and snapped up Ronaldo for a reported \u20ac200m (\u00a3177m) per year - the equivalent of \u00a33.3m per week.\n\nHis salary will be around $75m (\u00a362m) of that figure, with the rest made up through image rights and commercial deals. Expect Ronaldo to also front Saudi Arabia's 2030 World Cup bid.\n\nThe unheralded former\u00a0Arsenal player has done very well for himself after football as he is the co-founder of GF Biochemicals, the first company in the world to be able to mass-produce levulinic acid.\n\nIn short, it is a molecule made from plant waste that can be used as a substitute for petrol. He runs the company with partner Pasquale Granata.\n\nWith a believed net worth of over $10billion, he is worth more than his former club.\n\nBolkiah plays for Thai club Chonburi and was at the academies of English sides Southampton, Leicester and Chelsea - he grew up in England after being born in the United States.\n\nHe has also captained Brunei's national team and spent time playing for Maritimo in Portugal.\n\nHowever, before you start thinking the Thai League pays well, it is actually Faiq's family connections which account for his wealth.\n\nFor he is the son of Brunei's prince Jefri Bolkiah, while his uncle Hassanal is Sultan of the oil-rich kingdom.\n\nREAD MORE:\u00a0Seven players who were only really good for one club, including FIVE former Liverpool stars",

      "text": "Five Britons released from Russian detention in Ukraine after a prisoner swap have arrived back safely in the UK.\n\nOne of the men, Shaun Pinner, is now back at the family home near Sandy in Bedfordshire.\n\n\"It's good to be home,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to a steak dinner tonight!\"\n\nFor his mother, Debbie Price, the relief is overwhelming.\n\nShe told Sky's Emma Birchley: \"It's been a really, really hard time. We are just so happy to have him home. It's hugely emotional.\"\n\nRussia 'likely to struggle' to mobilise 300,000 troops - Ukraine war latest\n\nAiden Aslin, John Harding, Dylan Healy and Andrew Hill have been identified by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as the other Britons released.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Pinner's family said: \"We would like to thank everybody involved in Shaun's release, especially all at the Foreign Office, Liz Truss and her team, Boris Johnson and President Zelenskyy.\n\n\"Shaun would also like to thank the hospitality of the Saudi government and Prince Mohammed bin Salman al Saud who also assisted in the negotiations for his freedom.\n\n\"It's a very emotional time as you can expect and we are unable to currently discuss so early in his release any details fully.\n\n\"It's been a harrowing time for Shaun and our family which has now had such a happy resolution. Shaun is in good spirits and still has his sense of humour intact. He is looking forward to steak and a glass of red wine tonight.\n\n\"We are now enjoying some family time and would appreciate the privacy at this moment.\"\n\nBack in April, Mr Pinner and Aiden Aslin were captured by Russian forces who accused them of being mercenaries.\n\nAs a result, they appeared in court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, a breakaway region in eastern Ukraine, and were threatened with death by firing squad.\n\nAt the time, Mr Pinner's family stressed he was \"not a volunteer nor a mercenary, but officially serving with the Ukrainian army\".\n\nOn their flight home, Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner recorded a message, thanking those who had worked to free them.\n\n\"We're now out of the danger zone and on our way home to our families,\" said Mr Aslin.\n\n\"By the skin of our teeth,\" Mr Pinner, who is from Bedfordshire, added.\n\nPrior to their release, four of the men featured in video clips posted online or on Russian state TV.\n\nThe first hint Mr Pinner had that something was happening was after lunch on Tuesday.\n\n\"They said you have to roll your stuff up. They said you're going on a long journey,\" he said.\n\n'We were moved to another location. We didn't have any idea what was happening.\"\n\nHe was flown with other released captives to Saudi Arabia and at 5.30pm UK time on Wednesday, he was able to speak to his mother on the phone, from the Middle Eastern country.\n\n\"It's very emotional, as you can imagine,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the 48-year-old, who has been living in Ukraine since 2018, has many friends still there, as well as his wife.\n\nToday is their second wedding anniversary.\n\nIt's hoped she will be able to get a visa to also come to the UK.\n\nIn footage broadcast on Russian state TV in April, Mr Pinner said he had been fighting in the besieged port city of Mariupol for five to six weeks.\n\nIn the months before he appeared in court, he told Sky News he was on his fourth tour of duty in Ukraine after serving in the British Army for nine years.\n\nAfter the news broke the Britons would be returning to the UK, Prime Minister Liz Truss said she \"hugely welcomed\" the move, adding it would end \"months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families\".\n\nWho else was released?\n\nAlmost 300 people were released in the prisoner swap, many of them from the Ukrainian Azov regiment, which gained fame for its defence of the final stronghold in Mariupol.\n\nMr Harding was among the small group of soldiers who were holed up inside the Azovstal steelworks in the southeastern city.\n\nTen other foreigners have been released to Saudi Arabia before they return home, including Moroccan Brahim Saadoun, Americans Alexander Drueke and Andy Huynh, a Croatian, and a Swedish national.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: \"We remember all our people and try to save every Ukrainian.\n\n\"This is the meaning of Ukraine, our essence, this is what distinguishes us from the enemy.\"\n\nThe exchange took place unexpectedly, coming as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use nuclear weapons.\n\nIt was brokered with help from Turkey and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has close ties with Mr Putin.",

      "text": "RIYADH \u2014 Arriyadh Development Company (ARDCO) has finalized a deal to acquire a commercial building in Al Malqa district north of Riyadh, the company announced on Saturday.\n\nStrategically located near the intersection of King Fahd and King Salman roads in one of Riyadh\u2019s fastest-growing districts, the SR68 million tower is fully leased out to institutional tenants and is just slightly south of Riyadh Avenues development project.\n\nIt is a commercial, revenue-generating office tower built on a 3,346m 2 land and comprises 12 office floors, ground floor, mezzanine and two basements. The 10,500m2 net leasable area in addition to the advertising screen on top of the building expected to generate annual revenue of SR14.3 million.\n\n\u201cARDCO was established by the virtue of a Royal Decree three decades ago to realize the vision of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman when he was the governor of Riyadh Province, which translated into unprecedent development projects in the capital,\u201d said Jehad Alkadi, chief executive officer of ARDCO.\n\n\u201cThe company is determined to move forward banking on this rich legacy towards realizing Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 and the strategy that the Crown Prince had set out for the Riyadh city, highlights of which had been announced in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition comes as part of the board of directors\u2019 plans to diversify the company\u2019s real estate and investments portfolio. Given the building\u2019s prime location, it is expected to help achieve the company\u2019s investment targets, bolster its assets, and become one of many upcoming catalysts of its sustainable growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are currently working on enhancing the performance of our assets under real estate portfolio,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe expect to reach our target returns in the coming years underpinned by our acquisition of assets with attractive returns and by improving the performance of our existing real estate assets.\n\n\u201cThis in turn, will enable us to enhance the average return on assets concurrently with the chances of improving the performance of the commercial building in the future through an effective management of these investment assets.\u201d\n\nThe building\u2019s investment appeal stems from its long-term lease contracts that range between five to 10 years with top institutional financial and commercial corporations.\n\nEstablished by the virtue of a Royal Decree M/2 on July 28, 1993, ARDCO is a Public Joint Stock company that was founded with the intent to develop Qasr Al-Hukm area and adjacent developments in the center of Riyadh.\n\nThe mandate of the company has since expanded to include other developments across the capital, including several within the public good sector. The company operates four self-developed public good projects that employ more than 150 qualified talents and serve more than 20 million citizens and expatriates through over 2,000 tenants. \u2014 SG",

      "text": "A consortium of banks have initially indicated that five-year Sukuk (Islamic bond), ten-year Eurobond and another 30-year Eurobond with combined proceeds of around $2 to $3 billion can be floated. PHOTO: FILE\n\nThe government has raised Rs46.44 billion through the issuance of Ijarah Sukuks under the new series launched in October 2022 to finance the budget deficit and promote Shariah-compliant banking in Pakistan. Speaking to the Express Tribune, Meezan Bank Senior Executive Vice-President and Head of Shariah Compliance, Ahmed Ali Siddiqui said, \u201cUnder the new series, the government has started issuing Ijarah Sukuk bonds against the assets of the National Highway Authority (NHA).\u201d\n\nThe Ijarah Sukuks are Shariahcompliant bonds. The government issues the Sukuk to Islamic institutions which generate income by renting out the assets to the government. The latest rental Sukuk is a variable bond issued for a period of five years. Meezan Bank along with Dubai Islamic Bank and Al Falah Islamic Bank led the latest transaction as joint financial advisors to the Ministry of Finance. \u201cThe government may issue Sukuk worth around Rs600 billion against the NHA assets over the next few months,\u201d estimated Siddiqui.\n\nAs \u201cthe government has targeted issuing Sukuk bonds worth around Rs1 trillion in the current fiscal year 2023,\u201d it may identify new assets to issues more Sukuks in the next series later on. The ministry of finance has issued Sukuks worth Rs160 billion in the current fiscal year started July 1, 2022, including the latest one worth Rs46.44 billion. Under the previous series, in the prior six months (April \u2013 September 2022), the government issued Sukuks worth Rs624 billion against Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s (CAA) assets, including Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad airports.\n\nSo far, the government issued the Shariah-compliant bonds worth Rs3.7 billion, including the one that matured, since the first Sukuk issued in 2008 in Pakistan. It was learnt that the outstanding amount of Sukuks in place are estimated to be around Rs2.44 trillion. The outstanding worth of Sukuk stands equivalent to a little over 12% of the domestic debt raised from local banks. The rest of the slightly less than 88% (Rs17.48 trillion) debt was raised through conventional banks. About a year ago, the government targeted raising debt from banks to 10% from Shariah compliant banks in its medium-term strategy.\n\nA senate\u2019s resolution passed in 2018, however, urged the government to increase its share of domestic debt from Shariah-compliant banks to 30%, which is far away from the current market share of 12%. Industry officials are of the view that, \u201cThe cost (rate of return) of Shariah-compliant bonds stands low compared to the one the government pays on conventional debt securities like T-bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs)\u201d. \u201cIn the recent months, the finance ministry has issued a Sukuk which costs (rate of return) 100 basis points less than the conventional bonds.\n\nThe low cost has saved millions of rupees in interest payments to the government,\u201d an industry official claimed. The officials said, \u201cShariahcompliant banking is gaining traction in the country as more and more people, and businesses, shift to Islamic banking. On average, 1% of banking customers (deposits) are shifting to Islamic banking every year.\u201d In terms of deposits, the market share of Shariah compliant banks has grown to over 19% at present, compared to 12-13% in 2015. Besides, their share in housing finance and car-financing hit the range of 50%-60% each.",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",
