Ever since then, there has been speculation in the industry if the Iron Man of Spy Universe, Salman Khan too will be a part of the trailer.\n\nSCOOP: Aditya Chopra does a Marvel \u2013 cuts two trailers of Pathaan, one with Salman Khan and one without\n\nA source from Yash Raj Films informs, \"That's the suspense. Aditya Chopra is a mastermind, and he knows how to keep all the cards close to his chest. While the world is aware of Salman Khan's cameo in the film, he is in two minds - if that should be shown in the trailer or not. And hence, he had asked his production team to cut two promos of Pathaan - one with Salman Khan as Tiger and one without.\"\n\nThat's not all, the source told us further that Adi's idea is to inform everyone of Salman and his Spy Universe by following less is more. \"The entire campaign of Pathaan is less is more. So there might be less of Bhai, but the communication will stay intact. Who knows, you will get some hints about him in the trailer if not for a full-length presence. Adi has created the best scene of the film with the two biggest superstars of Hindi cinema - Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. Just wait for the film and the sequence to explode like never before,\" the source promised.\n\nAs reported by Bollywood Hungama before, Salman Khan has got the most heroic entry of his career on a helicopter in Pathaan to rescue SRK from the Russian Army. Which version of the Pathaan trailer will be dropped digitally, only time will tell\n\nAlso Read: Shah Rukh Khan unveils new fierce poster of Pathaan co-star Deepika Padukone on her birthday, says he is \u2018always proud\u2019 of her\n\nCatch us for latest Bollywood News, New Bollywood Movies update, Box office collection, New Movies Release , Bollywood News Hindi, Entertainment News, Bollywood Live News Today & Upcoming Movies 2023 and stay updated with latest hindi movies only on Bollywood Hungama.",

A large chunk of appointment-based viewership is dominated by the stars from the 90s and two names have been primarily consistent in getting viewership on this medium \u2013 Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan. The reason for their content to get viewership on the small screen has got a lot to do with their appeal and popularity in the markets that extended beyond the metro cities. Their content structure too is palatable to the taste buds of this section of audience, which often stays loyal to their stars.\n\nThe list of premieres in 2022 is yet again a testimony of Akshay\u2019s reach in the satellite audience. At the top of the list for Hindi Films is the Akshay Kumar starrer Sooryavanshi directed by Rohit Shetty, which saw its world television premiere in March 2022 on Zee Cinema and scored a TRP of 2.70. The cop universe saga reopened the cinema halls with a bang during the Diwali 2021 weekend and this was followed by good viewership on digital and satellite platforms. This is followed by\u00a0Antim starring Salman Khan and Aayush Sharma. The Mahesh Manjrekar directed isn't an\u00a0out and out Salman Khan film and has yet found itself a place in the top 2 Bollywood premieres of the year, which speaks volumes about the hold of SK in the satellite audience. The gangster drama scored a TRP of 2.10 upon it's world television premiere on Zee Network\n\nIt's a tie of Antim with the Anees Bazmee directed Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 starring Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani. The horror comedy premiered on Sony Max and scored an impressive rating of 2.10. The film has done well across platforms \u2013 from theatrical to digital and satellite \u2013 laying the base for Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3. The Kartik Aaryan fronted film is also the biggest premiere for a film that released in 2022.\n\nAt the third spot is another Akshay Kumar starrer \u2013 the Farhad Samji directed Bachchan Paandey co-starring Kriti Sanon. The action-packed entertainer scored a TRP of 1.85 upon its premiere on Star Gold. The top 5 premieres have the inclusion of yet another Khiladi film, the Aanand L Rai directed, Raksha Bandhan. The last week of 2022 saw the world television premiere of the Akshay Kumar fronted social drama, Raksha Bandhan on Zee Cinemas. The family drama has scored a good premiere on television with a TRP of 1.8.\u00a0The Khiladi has 3 films in the top 5 of 2022, and even if we go back in time to look at all-time top premieres one will find films like Laxmii and Housefull 4 among others. Ranveer Singh\u2019s sport drama, 83\u2019, also attracted eyeballs upon its world TV premiere. The Kabir Khan directed Kapil Dev Biopic got a TV rating of 1.79 on Star Gold.\n\nThe Kashmir Files does well on TV too\n\nVivek Ranjan Agnihotri\u2019s The Kashmir Files too scored a good premiere with a rating of 1.09. The Anupam Kher led film premiered on Zee Cinema. The Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial, Gangubai, with Alia Bhatt in lead also scored a decent premiere with ratings of 1.00 on Colours Cineplex. Jayeshbhai Jordaar on the other hand could manage to a TRP of 0.98. The other two YRF films \u2013 Prithviraj and Shamshera \u2013 scored similar numbers with a TRP of 0.85 and 0.90 for their premiere on the Star Network. The Nagraj Manjule directed Amitabh Bachchan starrer Jhund clocked a TV rating of 0.88 on Sony Max, whereas the Bunty Babli Sequel scored 0.70 on Star Gold. Films like Satyameva Jayate 2, Heropanti 2 and Attack\u00a0 scored a rating of 0.80, 0.75 and 0.72\u00a0upon their premiere.\u00a0The Akshay Kumar, Sara Ali Khan, Dhanush film Atrangi Re too clocked fair premiere with a TRP rating of 0.65. The Aamir Khan starrer, Laal Singh Chaddha takes the last spot with a television rating of 0.53, upon it\u2019s premiere on Colours Cineplex. There's Varun Dhawan and Kiara Advani's Jug Jugg Jeeyo too which premiered on TV last year, and we still await the data on it's world television premiere, but given the genre and channel reach, we believe the ratings would fall in the range of 0.70\u00a0to 1.00.\n\nStay Tuned To Pinkvilla For More Updates!\n\nALSO READ:\u00a0Top Hindi Dubbed TV Premieres of 2022: RRR, Pushpa & KGF 2 take the top 3 spots; Valimai emerges no.1 in Tamil",

Or will a Khan film snatch the top spot like in the old times? The latter is very much possible as both Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan will be having multiple releases, all of which seem very exciting. Shah Rukh Khan will have three films up for release \u2013\u00a0Pathaan,\u00a0Jawan,\u00a0and\u00a0Dunki.\u00a0Bollywood Hungama reported last year that all these three films have the potential to collect Rs. 300 crores each.\n\nSalman Khan, meanwhile, will have a proper theatrical release after December 2019 with\u00a0Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. It releases on Eid 2023 followed by\u00a0Tiger 3\u00a0on Diwali. Both have humongous expectations riding on them. Aamir Khan, meanwhile, won\u2019t have a release in 2023.\n\nTrade analyst Atul Mohan is quite confident of Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s films, especially\u00a0Jawan. He said, \u201cJawan\u00a0is a true pan-Indian film. Atlee is one of the biggest Tamil directors. Hence, Jawan can get a huge boost in the South. Atlee\u2019s film with Vijay did a business of Rs. 150-200 crores in Tamil Nadu. If the public there gives the same kind of love to\u00a0Jawan, imagine the overall business of the film.\u201d\n\nOn\u00a0Dunki\u00a0and\u00a0Tiger 3, he said, \u201cThe business of Rajkumar Hirani\u2019s film is more than his previous film. Even the Tiger franchise is becoming bigger. From 198.78 crores of\u00a0Ek Tha Tiger\u00a0(2012), the collections jumped to Rs. 339.16 crores in the case of\u00a0Tiger Zinda Hai\u00a0(2017). That\u2019s like a 70-80% jump. Even though it's a big film this year.\u201d\n\nAtul Mohan continued, \u201cPathaan\u2019s controversies are going to help the film. Siddharth Anand is one of the biggest directors we have today. All his films have stylish action sequences. So, all 3 films of Shah Rukh have immense potential. Shah Rukh Khan can become a pan-Indian star in 2023.\u201d\n\nRaj Bansal, the owner of Entertainment Paradise in Jaipur, agreed, \u201cAll 3 films of Shah Rukh Khan look fine.\u00a0Kitni badi hoti hai yeh toh waqt batayega. I can say with confidence that Pathaan, Jawan,\u00a0and\u00a0Dunki\u00a0will have a very huge opening.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cEven\u00a0Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan\u00a0and\u00a0Tiger 3 will open with a bang. After that, the content, music, etc will decide its fate\u201d\n\nTrade veteran Taran Adarsh also felt that Khan\u2019s films have a chance. He said, \u201cYes definitely (these 5 films can emerge as the biggest grossers). The year looks exciting, starting with Pathaan and so many other films, backed by stars. 2023 is going to be a significant year, provided Covid doesn\u2019t play spoilsport.\u201d\n\nFilm exhibitor and distributor Akshaye Rathi opined, \u201cWith\u00a0Pathaan,\u00a0Jawan,\u00a0Dunki\u00a0and\u00a0Tiger, I am sure both Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan will absolutely rock at the box office and give their fans the much-needed reason to celebrate all over again.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Pathaan Row: Pooja Bhatt differentiates between protest and riot after Bajrang Dal vandalises Ahemdabad mall\n\nCatch us for latest Bollywood News, New Bollywood Movies update, Box office collection, New Movies Release , Bollywood News Hindi, Entertainment News, Bollywood Live News Today & Upcoming Movies 2023 and stay updated with latest hindi movies only on Bollywood Hungama.",

He once again made fun of the film during an appearance on a show, hosted by Salman Khan. (Also read: Anurag Kashyap reacts to Ranveer Singh's remark on being dropped from Bombay Velvet)\n\nIn the video, Ranveer tells paparazzi at what seems to be an award night, \u201cManiesh Paul aye host humare aaj raat ke. I think unhone bhi aaj \u2018velvet\u2019 hi pehna hain. Velvet se yaad aya, mere picture ke bare mein baat karte hain.

He was also with co-star Sara Ali Khan and director Rohit Shetty. During the show, Ranveer jokingly mentioned about his thoughts around Bombay Velvet again. \u201cEk baar maine sanch mein bohot aansu bahaye they jab maine Bombay Velvet dekha tha,\u201d Ranveer shared and left the audience and the Simmba film team in splits.\n\nHe further added, \u201cAudience aab toh aap hans rahe hain. Uss waqt pe aap bhi bohot roye they. Mujhe pata hain (People in the audience might be laughing now but I know they must have cried too).\u201d While everyone laughed at him, Salman maintained a gentle look on his face.\n\nReacting to the old situations, a user took to the comment section and wrote, \u201cSalman\u2019s reaction is on point.\u201d \u201cSalman's look explains what he had in his future,\u201d added another one hinting towards Ranveer\u2019s film Cirkus which just released with bad critical reviews. Someone also said, \u201cIf you make a bad film, people will make fun of you. Ranveer shouldn't get pissed of when people will make fun of circus.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Ranveer earlier said he was the first choice for Bombay Velvet. However he was dropped after being offered the project. His role went to Ranbir Kapoor. During his appearance on Koffee With Karan season 7. Ranveer said, \u201cI was not rejected, K (Karan Johar). I was unceremoniously dropped because at the time I couldn\u2019t justify the budget. My star value wasn\u2019t high. But things have changed.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Ranveer Singh\u2019s claims, Anurag Kashyap recently told Pinkvilla, \u201cAfter very long, Ranveer Singh revealed that he was also offered the movie and that he was dropped from the project because he would not be able to generate enough money. Interestingly, he is making movies with the very same people from the industry. So it's not like that. This industry is a weird place. Consequences are mine and that's why I went to make films in a controlled budget where no one loses money. I don't want to make a blockbuster and I am not competing with anyone. The idea should be big and the film should be made in a controlled budget. The film becoming big is not in your hands,\" he reasoned. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, Bombay Velvet couldn\u2019t survive at box office after mixed reviews from critics.",

      "text": "On Friday's episode, host Salman Khan will be seen scolding Bigg Boss 16 contestants Tina Datta and Shalin Bhanot for their closeness during MC Stan's recent new year concert. The two almost shared a kiss as they danced together, which was noticed by the housemates. In the promo shared by ColorsTV, Salman asked Tina if she did not have anyone else apart from Shalin to dance with at the new year bash. Tina then clarified that she was not falling in love with Shalin. (Also read: As angry Shalin Bhanot throws objects again, Bigg Boss 16 fans say \u2018no wonder Dalljiet left him\u2019)\n\nThe channel shared the promo on their social media handles with the caption, \u201cIss Shukravaar Ka Vaar mein, Salman Khan ke karaare sawaalonn ke dena padega Tina aur Shalin ko jawaab (in Friday's episode, Tina and Shalin have to answer Salman Khan's questions).\"\n\nThe promo opened with Salman asking Tina, \u201cTina konsa game khel rahi aur kiske saath (Tina, which game you are playing and with whom)?\u201d Tina replied, \u201cMai dhong nhi karti hoon (I don't pretend to lie).\u201d She further said, \u201cSir, we cannot fall in love\u201d with reference to Shalin. An angry Salman then said, \u201cJhagda hogya, music baja aur ye chal raha hai (the fight happened, but when the music was played and you were dancing together).\u201d\n\nSalman enacted Shalin and Tina's cosy moments in front of the contestants. He continued, \u201cBaaki koi nahi tha dance karne ke laayak ya chipakna ke laayak (there was nobody in the house to dance with you or get so close with you)?\u201d Shalin then said to Salman, \u201cDon't be hard on her.\u201d A furious Salman then said, \u201cWhat? No, no say it, say it.\u201d\n\nReacting to the video, one person commented, \u201cFake hai dono, dono ko dafa karo (Both of them are fake, throw them out of the house) Supoort real one MC Stan (red heart and fire emojis).\u201d Another person wrote, \u201cBest part Salman sir ka dance (Salman's dance) with laughing emojis.\u201d Other person commented, \u201cSahi baat hai.. nautanki in logo ki khatam nhi ho rahi (Salman is right\u2026 their drama is never ending).\u201d A comment also read, \u201cWell said, Salman sir (clapping emojis)\u201d.\" Another one read, \u201cThey are faking the whole scene.\"\n\nBigg Boss 16 airs Monday to Friday at 10pm, and on Saturday and Sunday at 9pm on ColorsTV.",

      "text": "In the upcoming episode of 'Bigg Boss 16', show's host Salman Khan will be seen addressing issues between Archana Gautam and MC Stan, who recently engaged in a war of words.\n\nA promo shared by the channel on Instagram, shows Salman talking to Stan. He is heard saying: \"Maa-Baap ke upar jaane ka matlab kya hai yaar (Why talk about parents.)\"\n\nHe asks Stan to judge himself and tell him if he was right or wrong in the case. The rapper apologised.\n\nSalman then spoke to Archana and told: \"Archana aapne kaha na khairaat me aya hai. Agar iss ghar me koi khairaat me aya hai na toh woh Archana hai (You said he has come as charity. If there is anyone here that has came as charity, it is you.)\" Not agreeing with Salman, Archana said: \"Sir, main sahi hun.\"\n\nAn angry Salman then said: \"Agar yeh aapka attitude hai toh abhi ke abhi darwaza kholta hun, jayiye aap.\" Archana and Stan got into a fight over house duties.\n\nShe had said: \"Kab tak janta ki khayraat mein rahega yaha pe? Janta aese ghatiya logo ko pasand nahi karti. Iske saare fans ko main bolna chahti hun isne jharu nahi lagayi (For how long will you stay on people's charity? People don't like such terrible people. I want to tell all his fans that he did bot sweep.)\"\n\nStan replied: \"Tere baap ka naukar hai kya?\" and Archana replied, \"Mera baap Bigg Boss hai, uska toh naukar hai na.\" After which, an ugly verbal exchange took place leading to both talking about their parents.

And while many fans hope to meet their hero someday, one fan from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh was actually able to fulfill his wish recently to meet the actor.\n\nSalman Khan was reportedly quite impressed to meet his die-hard fan called Sameer, who had travelled all of 1100 km on his bicycle to meet his idol. When the fan reached Khan\u2019s residence, he was already in, and so the two were able to catch up. According to ETimes, the two also discussed Salman\u2019s upcoming projects, including the highly anticipated actioner Tiger 3.\n\nLater, fan accounts shared photos of the pair. Khan looked dapper in forest green pants and black t-shirt as he posed with his superfan and his cycle, which had Being Human (Khan\u2019s brand) written all over it.\n\nSalman Khan is also said to have invited Sameer inside for a meal and even arranged a place to stay for him while he was in the Maximum City, reported MensXP. The photos have been getting varied responses from users. While some appreciated Sameer\u2019s dedication to meet Khan, others dismissed it as just another unnecessary act by a besotted fan.\n\nOne person wrote, \u201cBhai ho to aisa,\u201d while another commented, \u201cWe love you.\u201d One person made fun of the whole exercise and wrote, \u201cI would not even cycle 1 km for this.\u201d Yet another person wrote, \u201cSalute to you both.\u201d\n\nOn the work front, Salman Khan is looking forward to at least two releases \u2014 Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan and the Maneesh Sharma directorial Tiger 3, co-starring Katrina Kaif, and Emraan Hashmi as the antagonist.",

      "text": "Salman Khan is one of the very few actors who is hardly spotted in anything other than his own clothing brand, Being Human, when he is not hosting Bigg Boss 16 or starring in a film. The actor had once said in an interview that he doesn't wear very expensive clothes so that his fans don't waste money in order to copy his style. He had also said that if a person has a good body, he will look good in any kind of clothes. (Also read: Salman Khan dances with a glass in his pocket in Riteish Deshmukh-starrer Ved song teaser, fans call it 'new trend')\n\nSalman is currently gearing up for his next, Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. He was recently seen in Chiranjeevi's Telugu film Godfather.\n\nIn an old interview with Taran Adarsh for Music India, Salman was asked about his massive fan following. The video clip was recently shared on Reddit. The actor had said, \"I think they see a common man in me. I don't like to live like a star. Main jeans pahanta hu fati hui, Being Human ki t-shirts pahanta hu, ek pair of boots sada hua pata nhi kabse (I wear torn jeans, Being Human t-shirts and old boots since ages). Kyunki you can afford to dress up well. Dressing doesn't mean to buy expensive clothes. Salaries are so less, families are so big. Jo cheez hum pahante hain (the clothes we wear), the children want it, the fans want it. Ab Armani ka suit pahanenge, ya Versace ya Dolce and Gabbana doesn't make any difference. I would rather wear the most ill-fitting clothes which would look good because you go to the gym.

That is something I keep on doing. We have to wear other clothes in films for the sake of scenes.\n\nFans of the actor had positive to mixed reactions to the video on Reddit. A user wrote, \u201cSurprisingly (to me), bhai seems like the kind of guy who would think about this. He seems quite hyper-aware of his fanbase's demographics in the recent years.

And if yes, what\u2019s the worst pick-up line you have heard?\u201d\n\nSalman replied jokingly as he laughed, \u201cPick up ka toh pata nahi lekin ladki ne drop zaroor kiya hai mujhe (I am not sure about the pick-up but girls have certainly dropped me).\u201d Vicky and Kiara also joined him laughing. The host then added, \u201cWell, to be honest, I don\u2019t remember any such pick up line.\u201d\n\nDuring their visit to the Bigg Boss house, Vicky and Kiara donned the role of radio jockeys and asked the contestants various questions. The actors also dedicated songs to the contestants.\n\nSalman Khan has been rumoured to date many girls in his life. These include Aishwarya Rai, Sangeeta Bijlani, Katrina Kaif, Iulia Vantur, among many others. Salman, however, has never spoken about his relationships.\n\nDirected by Shashank Khaitan, Govinda Naam Mera also stars Bhumi Pednekar and Renuka Shahane in lead roles. The film is a murder mystery and it landed online on Disney+ Hotstar on December 16.\n\nVicky will next be seen in Anand Tiwari's upcoming film along side Triptii Dimri. The film is yet-to-be-titled film and is set for a theatrical release on July 28, 2023. He also has the ambitious project, Meghna Gulzar's Sam Bahadur lined up for next. Vicky essays the role of Sam Manekshaw, who was the Chief of Army Staff during the India-Pakistan war in 1971, in the film.\n\nSalman Khan was recently seen in a cameo in Chiranjeevi's Telugu film Godfather. He has Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan and the third film in his hit franchise, Tiger 3, lined up for next.",

Prakash said he doesn\u2019t look at Salman as an actor, but as a prank-loving, goofy child.\n\nSpeaking to Lallantop, the actor said, \u201cI don\u2019t look at him as an actor, I look at him as a pranky kid. He will never get old. He has no filter. He is not criminal-minded. I have done two films with him, I like his company. Wo kisi se darta nahi hai (He is not scared of anybody).\u201d\n\nPrakash Raj then went on to state that Salman Khan arrives to set late, and works at his own pace, because he knows his market, and he is comforted in the knowledge of having a considerable fan base. As the actor made these remarks, his Mukhbir co-star Adil Hussain was seen laughing.\n\nNot so long ago, Prakash had opened up about losing work owing to his political bluntness. \u201cIt is getting affected. Now, some people don\u2019t work with me not because they have been told not to. But because they are worried \u2018they\u2019 may not approve. I am strong and rich enough to lose all that. I always feel my fear will be somebody\u2019s power,\u201d the actor had told Hindustan Times.\n\nPrakash Raj is currently seen in the ZEE5 espionage series Mukhbir.\n\nMeanwhile, Salman Khan is looking forward to the release of the action-packed Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. The film marks the Bollywood debut of Shehnaaz Gill, and also features Pooja Hegde.",

In the promo, Salman can be heard saying, \u201cFirst you make Abdu write birthday messages for Nimrit and then you tell him to stay away from her. I am not able to understand this (dual behaviour).\u201d\n\nSalman Khan is referring to the incident where Abdu Rozik asked for Sajid Khan's help to wish Nimrit Kaur on her birthday. It was Sajid Khan who asked Abdu to write \u201cHappy Birthday, Nimmi\u201d on his body to wish her. Instead, Abdu asked his fellow contestants to write \u201cI love you\u201d on his back, but they wrote vile words\u00a0instead.\n\nThursday's episode saw Sajid Khan stating that Nimrit Kaur was not doing enough to tell Abdu Rozik that she cannot date him. He insinuated that she was giving Abdu hope, leaving Nimrit in tears. While explaining that he was only trying to help Abdu and Nimrit, Sajid said, \u201cPeople are making fun of you as you keep doing \u2018Nimmi Nimmi' throughout. You will get hurt. I am trying to protect you.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the video here:\n\nThe upcoming episode will also see Vicky Kaushal and Kiara Advani visiting the sets of Bigg Boss 16 to promote their film Govinda Naam Mera.\n\nThis week Shiv Thakare, Sajid Khan, Tina Datta, and Shalin Bhanot have been nominated for elimination. You can watch Bigg Boss 16 on Colors TV from Monday to Friday at 10 PM. The weekend episodes air at 9.30 PM.\u00a0 The show is also available on the streaming platform Voot Select with a 24*7 stream.",

Karan, in an earlier interview, which has now been uploaded on YouTube by the channel WildFilms India, revealed that that was the case. \u201cI thought it (the second male lead) should be a star because the actor had to drag Kajol to the man she loves, so I thought ye koi bhi kare toh it will not be good.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Alvira, Salman Khan\u2019s sister is a very good friend of mine. I was at her place and we were talking about the film, and Salman was there and wanted to know about it, I really did not think he would do it. He asked about the actors who were there, and the days he would have to devote to it. He said, I will do it, and I said really? He said narrate it to me, and then he heard it, and asked for money, big money at that time, very very big money. So I told my father. He said however wonderful Salman is, we don\u2019t have the budget.\u201d\n\nThe director and producer then recounted how he went to actors like Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachur Singh, and was rejected by both.\n\n\u201cThen we went to Saif, and Saif said \u2018I don\u2019t want to take a risk, my career is just taking off.\u2019 So that night I was very upset and my friends called me and said come.

The superstar enjoys a huge fan following now and has come a long way since his debut film Maine Pyar Kiya. But did you know, he once pissed off veteran actor Raaj Kumar during a party? Scroll down to know more.\n\nSalman became a household name after the success of his film Maine Pyar Kiya, which was helmed by veteran Hindi film director Sooraj Barjatya. The filmmaker had organized the success party for the movie. Several stalwarts of Indian cinema at that time attended the party.\n\nIconic actor Raaj Kumar also attended the party. As soon as he reached the venue, he told Sooraj Barjatya that he wanted to meet the film\u2019s lead actor. The filmmaker then introduced Salman to the veteran actor. As per News 18 report, it was the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor\u2019s first meeting with the veteran star, and when the latter greeted him, Salman asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nRaaj Kumar is well known for his blunt nature. He was shocked when he heard this from Salman Khan, who had just grabbed the limelight with his first hit movie. Irked Raaj Kumar told Salman, \u201cSon, go ask your father who we are.\u201d\n\nThe superstar soon realized his mistake and apologized to him after this incident.\n\nThough Maine Pyar Kiya was a defining moment in Salman Khan\u2019s career, he found himself overshadowed by co-star Bhagyashree. During an earlier interview, the actor said that his co-star Bhagyashree got married, left the cinema, and walked away with all the credit for the film.\n\nMaine Pyar Kiya was based on a typical story of a wealthy man-meets-poor girl romance in which Prem (Salman) and Suman (Bhagyashree) fall in love and endure family differences. The film was well-received by critics and audiences alike, and it went on to become the highest-grossing film of the 1980s.\n\nMust Read: Harnaaz Sandhu Gets Brutally Fat Shamed As She Cooks \u2018Jalebis\u2019 In A New Video, Netizen Says \u201cLooking Like Miss Worst Day By Day\u201d",

      "text": "The year 2022 will go down as a defining phase for the Hindi film industry, in which its most trusted movie stars fizzled out on the big screen. It wasn\u2019t the acclaim that eluded Bollywood\u2013because even in a lackluster year, it managed to deliver critical darlings\u2013but the box office glory which remained largely missing. According to multiple industry experts, basis the 2022 report card of Hindi film stars, the writing is on the wall: Go big or go home.\n\nThe year 2022 will go down as a defining phase for the Hindi film industry, in which its most trusted movie stars fizzled out on the big screen. It wasn\u2019t the acclaim that eluded Bollywood\u2013because even in a lackluster year, it managed to deliver critical darlings\u2013but the box office glory which remained largely missing. According to multiple industry experts, basis the 2022 report card of Hindi film stars, the writing is on the wall: Go big or go home.\n\nAfter the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the Hindi film industry restarted its business on a smashing note with Rohit Shetty\u2019s Sooryavanshi last Diwali. Ironically, 2022 closed with another Shetty directorial, Ranveer Singh starrer Cirkus, which opened to disastrous numbers and is on its way to turn into a major box office dud.\n\nBetween Sooryavanshi and Cirkus, Bollywood could only manage to deliver superhits like Alia Bhatt-Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s Gangubai Kathiawadi, Anees Bazmee\u2019s comedy Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Ayan Mukerji-directed Brahmastra led by Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, Vivek Agnihotri\u2019s The Kashmir Files and Ajay Devgn-starrer Drishyam 2.\n\nA simple reading of what worked for Bollywood in 2022 gives an obvious answer: That the future for the industry and its movie stars is films riding on franchise or the promise of a big-screen experience.\n\nExhibitor Vishek Chauhan tells indianexpress.com that stars like Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar and Hrithik Roshan now need to do \u201conly branded entertainment and franchises.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they do originals, they need to amp up their stakes and go all out. Don\u2019t play safe. Invest heavy money, make it big and not like a small, calculated project. If you want to bring audience to theatres, dazzle them with scale. Even in Hollywood, Tom Cruise works big time in Mission Impossible and Top Gun, but his original films struggle.\n\n\u201cYou can dabble in smaller films, even do an OTT project, but first they have to fire guns at box office. Theatrical entertainment, as of today, looks to be completely branded entertainment,\u201d he says.\n\nVishek believes the reliance on franchise cinema should be there \u201cto revive the market\u201d, as the audience in 2022 has given a clear signal regarding what they want to see on the big screen.\n\nIn 2022, Aamir Khan retuned to the big screen with Laal Singh Chaddha, four years after his dud Thugs of Hindostan . To put things in perspective, the lifetime collection of Laal Singh Chaddha\u2013a film which mostly received positive reviews\u2013was slightly above the opening day of Thugs, a film which was panned on day one itself.\n\nHrithik Roshan\u2019s big screen outing Vikram Vedha, three years after his career\u2019s biggest hit War, also fizzled out at the box office despite wide-spread critical acclaim.\u00a0Ajay Devgn, before he tasted success with a 200 crore plus Drishyam 2, had failed twice with Runway 34 and comedy Thank God.\n\nRanbir Kapoor, who had given a dud with Shamshera, delivered one of the biggest hits of the year with his fantasy epic spectacle Brahmastra. If Rohit Shetty has failed this year with an original comedy like Cirkus, he will revive himself with his next, Singham Again, the third installment of the super hit franchise.\n\n\u201cOnce the market is back to a great level, where there is a strong momentum with four-five blockbusters, then we can squeeze in an experiment, a small little film. But now, you have to do big films. Even in Hollywood, your big-ticket branded franchise entertainment is bringing in huge numbers, from Avatar, Marvel to Maverik. Nothing else,\u201d Vishek adds.\n\nShah Rukh Khan is the first star, who will arrive at the 2023 box office with his actioner Pathaan, part of Yash Raj Films\u2019 spy universe of Salman\u2019s Tiger and Hrithik\u2019s War franchise. Shah Rukh will follow with Jawan, his first collaboration with box office favourite Atlee, a filmmaker known for giving blockbusters in Tamil.\n\nA filmmaker on the condition of anonymity shared with indianexpress.com that it was about time Shah Rukh switched to movies that would \u201cjustify\u201d his star pull. \u201cThere is no denying that he has had a bad last decade. He dabbled in comedies, action, romance and then did experiments like Fan and Zero, which to me would have worked in his favour if he had delivered three-four blockbusters.\n\n\u201cBut in the absence of that and only experiments, even though daring for a star at that stage in his career, his flops looked massive. There was a constant chatter in the industry that a star like him should do big movies which can guarantee box office. If his line up indicates that, there is no cause to worry.\u201d\n\nWhile Pathaan and Jawan are the obvious big-ticket movie outings, Shah Rukh also has a Dunki, filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani\u2019s next directorial. The film, expected to release in December 2023, is rumoured to be a comedy drama. It is the only non-event film choice of Shah Rukh\u2019s line-up and Vishek says, the film can actually be a \u201ccase study\u201d.\n\n\u201cRajkumar Hirani has been the darling of urban audience, his films are intelligent and are drama heavy. At least right now, the situation isn\u2019t the same. To expect it to do crazy numbers like he had done pre-pandemic is unfair.\n\n\u201cThe film will be a good test case. It can change of course, if Rajkumar Hirani mounts it on a big scale, if it is promoted like an unmissable original film, exactly the way Brahmastra did, then we shall see where it goes,\u201d Vishek adds.\n\nIf Shah Rukh is going full-proof big with his movies, so is Salman. The mass-favourite superstar would feature in the big scale comedy drama Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan and will follow with his Diwali release, Tiger 3. Ajay will return in 2023 with his much-awaited sports drama Maidaan and Bholaa, remake of the Tamil hit Kaithi. Devgn is reportedly planning to turn Bholaa into a franchise.\n\nVishek says the shift in terms of the stars choosing only mega-scale films is because they know\u2013and some have witnessed it firsthand after their films bombed in 2022\u2013that the audience has become \u201cdiscerning\u201d.\n\n\u201cEarlier they would watch an Ayushmann Khurrana film too, but today his theatrical standing has suffered. Not just him but Rajkummar Rao, Vicky Kaushal are also now not theatrical. The only way they can work theatrically is if they are also a part of a franchise. If Vicky does Uri 2, that\u2019s guaranteed opening. When Ayushmann will come with Dream Girl 2 and Rajkummar with Stree 2, they will give openings. But if they do an original, new film, that will be difficult.\n\n\u201cWhat Shah Rukh needs to do is dig into his filmography and pull-out franchises. After Pathaan, why not a Don? For Salman, why not a Dabangg after Tiger? It\u2019s high time that Hrithik got back to Krrish, or a War 2. That\u2019s the only way forward.\u201d\n\nBut Hindi movie stars\u2019 big outings won\u2019t be a cakewalk. Post pandemic, and especially after the success of South films like Pushpa, KGF: Chapter 2, RRR and Kantara, the audience is used to a certain level of \u201cmass\u201d films that Bollywood filmmakers have failed to offer.\n\nA trade source shares that the mass genre is where Bollywood needs to work the most if it wants to find success in it. \u201cIt is very simple; the definition of mass films is often misunderstood. You cannot take your audience for granted by giving trash in the name of mass. There is a reason why Shamshera, Heropanti 2, Satyameva Jayate 2 didn\u2019t work. These were just lazy, bad films. If the stars repeat the same mistake of signing anything random in the name of mass and spectacle, then the results won\u2019t be any different.\u201d\n\nTo put things in perspective, Bollywood had a steady stream of mass films throughout the 90s and mid-2000s which slowly started to fade and eventually got wiped out post 2010. Two Aamir Khan films, Vishek says, were instrumental in the rise of urban audience centric content.\n\n\u201cDil Chahta Hai (2001) was an important film for Bollywood, for it showed the power of urban audience, where the niche audience flexed their muscles. Post that film, there was a flood of new age directors, all of a sudden, your cash cow, the masala films, your larger-than-life films and big comedies slowly started to fade.\n\n\u201cThe frequency started to drop drastically. We eventually got our first urban blockbuster with 3 Idiots (2009), which actually had not worked at all in smaller towns, where it did marginal business. The film that did really well that year in these sectors was Salman\u2019s Wanted.\u201d\n\nBollywood had a great phase from 2009 till 2019, where the quality of content shot up. Every major star and actor experimented merrily.\u00a0 Hrithik did Guzaarish (2010), Aamir did Dangal, Salman had Sultan, Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Akshay found his new groove with more multiplex-friendly audience stepping out to watch his films post Special 26 (2013).\n\n\u201cIn all of this, your mass base started getting eroded. Salman would do one film, then we had a Tiger Shroff and then a Milap Zaveri became a success. Bollywood had stopped making cinema that the masses had to watch. But with COVID, Bollywood is in the phase where Hollywood was in 2008, when they released Iron Man.\n\n\u201cThe film changed the concept of a big film, there was a \u2018Marvel-isation\u2019 of the mainstream theatrical space. Post that, Hollywood didn;t look. Will Smith, Adam Sandler, Will Farrell, all theatrically died post Iron Man and never got back their groove. Stars died and that\u2019s what happened with COVID to Bollywood,\u201d Vishek adds.\n\nThe verdict of 2022 is out, that merely having stars in a project doesn\u2019t guarantee an opening, forget about success. The audience is not coming out to watch films in theatres unless they feel confident, usually after multiple confirmations through a film\u2019s trailer and songs.",

He recollected the time when Salman Khan \u2013 the film\u2019s lead lavished appreciation on him and he thought of it as fake news.\n\nAs Tiger Zinda Hai completes five years on Thursday, Sajjad thanked his audience for their support and love, as he said, \u201cPlaying Abu Usman in \u2018Tiger Zinda Hai\u2019 has been a life-changing experience, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to the entire cast and staff that made this happen. I am the kind of actor who works without expectations, so everything appears rewarding to me.\u201d\n\nWalking down memory lane, Sajjad Delafrooz further mentioned, \u201cThe first time I read Salman Bhai\u2019s appreciation for me, I messaged my manager if it\u2019s fake news? Coming from Salman bhai was surprising and I was so overwhelmed. Salman Bhai\u2019s words have just inspired me to work even harder\u201d.\n\nRecalling his experience working with Salman Khan, Sajjad Delafrooz went on to say, \u201cI still remember my experience working on the sets with Bhai and Katrina Kaif, and how he even gave me a few fitness tips. I am now looking forward to portraying more such versatile characters\u201d.\n\nTaking to his Instagram handle, theSajjad Delafrooz also shared a video in which Salman Khan, and the film\u2019s director Ali Abbas Zafar praise his work and dedication. The actor captioned this post as, \u201c5 Years of Tiger Zinda Hai\u2026 5 Years of Those Beautiful words from Salman Bhai (sic)\u201d.\n\nMust Read: When Salman Khan Reportedly Slapped Katrina Kaif At A Coffee Shop, Netizens Remember Aishwarya Rai Bachchan & Ask \u201cHow Can Abhishek Bachchan Be Friends With Him?\u201d",

Salman, dressed in a black suit, was seen posing with the bride and groom.\n\nShilpa Shetty, wearing a read saree, was also seen getting clicked with the newly-weds and their family. Ranveer Singh, meanwhile, performed on stage in his charismatic style.\n\nRanveer was seen singing the chartbuster Aankh Maare from his hit film Simmba, as guests crooned and grooved to his tune. The actor is gearing up for the release of his next, Cirkus.\n\nThe comedy marks Ranveer\u2019s third collaboration with filmmaker Rohit Shetty after Simmba and last year\u2019s blockbuster Sooryavanshi. Cirkus is scheduled to release on December 23.\n\nSalman, meanwhile, will be seen in three feature films next year\u2013 in a cameo in Pathaan with Shah Rukh Khan, action-comedy Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan and Tiger 3, the third instalment of the blockbuster franchise.",

Let\u2019s take a look at some of these evergreen bachelors of Bollywood:\n\nSalman Khan, 56, has been in several relationships, but it seems marriage is not what he desires. Salman has always given a witty response, when asked about his single status or plans to settle down. There have been numerous rumours about his marriage in the last decade, but none turned out to be true.\n\nAkshaye Khanna is still single. The 47-year-old has appeared in many hit films and is still active in Bollywood. But when it comes to marriage, this actor seems least interested. According to reports, Karisma Kapoor\u2019s father wanted her to marry Akshaye; but the actress\u2019s mother, Babita, refused, and talks of the duo\u2019s marriage ended there. In one of his interviews, Akshaye stated that he believes he is not marriage material.\n\nRandeep Hooda, who is 46 years old, has carved out a unique identity in Bollywood. He is a critically-acclaimed actor and chooses his films accordingly. Many rumours related to his romantic relationships have made headlines. His name has also been linked to actresses such as Neetu Chandra and Sushmita Sen; but when it comes to marriage, Randeep says he has not yet made a decision.\n\nKaran Johar celebrated his 50th birthday this year with a grand party. He is a single father of twins. Through surrogacy, he has a son named Yash Johar and a daughter named Roohi Johar. Karan once mentioned that he considers himself fortunate that marriage is not in his destiny or his thoughts. He said he is committed to his production company, and each of his films is his child. He also says that one should just be happy, even if they don\u2019t get married.\n\nSajid Khan is making a lot of headlines these days, and the reason for this is Bigg Boss 16. Sajid is currently a contestant on one of TV\u2019s most popular reality shows, Bigg Boss 16, where he is making quite a stir. The 52-year-old director is not married. It\u2019s not that Sajid didn\u2019t want to marry; he was also engaged to actress Gauhar Khan, but it fell through.

Salman and Chiranjeevi launched the Hindi trailer of the film in Mumbai on Saturday. At the press conference after the launch, Salman spoke about how the actors from the north and south can work together to make their films even more successful.\n\nHe said, \u201cSee, people want to go to Hollywood, I want to go to the south. The thing is that once we all start working together, just imagine the numbers that we\u2019ll have. People watch it here, people watch it in the south, you have all the theatres. You know fans go and watch me, my fans become his fans, his fans become my fans, so just everyone grows and grows and grows, the numbers become very large.

It is an equation of jokes, stories, encouragement and above all, respect. Khan\u2019s juggernaut personality, which often single handedly powers through his macho-actioners, is in stark contrast to the world of Barjatya, who has only placed him in multiple versions of a loveable, innocent, soft man Prem.\n\nFilmmaker Sooraj Barjatya says in his long-time collaborator and friend Salman Khan, he has found a relationship that goes beyond movies. It is an equation of jokes, stories, encouragement and above all, respect. Khan\u2019s juggernaut personality, which often single handedly powers through his macho-actioners, is in stark contrast to the world of Barjatya, who has only placed him in multiple versions of a loveable, innocent, soft man Prem.\n\nIn an interview with indianexpress.com, the filmmaker says their collaboration\u2013from Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, Hum Saath-Saath Hain to Prem Ratan Dhan Payo\u2013 has been of family films because Salman Khan, unknown to many, is \u201cthe family guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly there are months when we don\u2019t talk or meet. He is also busy; I keep to myself when I am writing. But we keep talking and he keeps encouraging me to make more films. He keeps encouraging me to make more family films. He says, \u2018Let\u2019s make what we used to make, bring back that.\u2019 He trusts me with the family films.\n\n\u201cEssentially, if you ask me, he is a family guy. If you go into the core of Salman Khan, what he projects sometimes is something else because essentially, he is that elder son who loves his brothers, sisters and respects his parents so much. I have never seen someone more respectful than him,\u201d Barjatya says.\n\nThe filmmaker says he was in the middle of writing a film for the superstar but when the pandemic happened, he started drifting towards another project, Uunchai- a film about three friends in their 60s, on a mission to scale Mount Everest.\n\n\u201cWhen I was writing a film for him, I told him that I have voice which is asking me to make Uunchai. He laughed and said, \u2018Sooraj where will you go, this is not your style!\u2019 But the voice in me was too strong and he understood, encouraged me. He recently saw the trailer and told me he loved it. Our relationship is beyond filmmaking.\u201d\n\nThe filmmaker says the idea of him collaborating with Khan is with the awareness that they should \u201ccreate something that we can leave behind, something with a lot of family values.\u201d After Uunchai, he will dive into the production of his younger son Avnish\u2019s directorial and will then focus on the film with Khan.\n\n\u201cI have a version written, the structure is there, but there is still for that to begin. I will require some more time for the project because if I am working with him, it has to be special. The film is in the family space. Till then I am busy as a producer with my younger son Avnish\u2019s movie, starring Rajveer and Paloma.

On Tuesday, Salman made a grand entrance at his brother-in-law Aayush Sharma\u2019s birthday party, and as usual, fans are happy to see him back in his form.\n\nAccording to reports circulating on social media in the past few days, Salman was diagnosed with dengue last week.\n\nLast week, a source informed ANI that Salman has not been keeping well and has taken a brief break from hosting \u2018Bigg Boss\u2019. However, the source did not confirm his dengue diagnosis.\n\nBut Salman\u2019s recent outing has come as a respite for his fans, who are relieved to see their favourite star fit and fine.\n\nFilmmaker Karan Johar has stepped in to host the 16th season of \u2018Bigg Boss\u2019 for a while. Besides Bigg Boss, Salman was also busy shooting for his film \u2018Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan\u2019.\n\n\u2018Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan\u2019 is scheduled to release on Eid 2023. It is billed as an action-packed entertainer directed by Farhad Samji and also features Pooja Hegde, and Venkatesh Daggubati in lead roles. Shehnaaz Gill and Palak Tiwari are also a part of the project.\n\nThe film is produced by Salman Khan Films and promises to have all the elements that one expects of a Salman Khan Film \u2013 action, comedy, drama, romance and emotions.\n\nRecently, Salman also announced that his film \u2018Tiger 3\u2019 with Katrina Kaif will be out on Diwali 2023.",

      "text": "Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi has openly criticized superstar Salman Khan for allegedly destroying his career. The \u2018Shootout at Lokhandwala\u2018 star\u2019s tussle against the \u2018Dabangg\u2018 actor has not been resolved for years.\n\nThe tiff between Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi started in 2003. They had dated their fellow actor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The \u2018Omkara\u2018 star called a press conference where he claimed that the \u2018Tiger Zinda Hai\u2018 star threatened him for being close to the \u201cGuzaarish\u201d star 41 times in a drunken state.\n\nVivek Oberoi\u2019s career went downhill after the allegations. He could not work in films. He has apologized to Salman Khan but things are just the same.\n\nSalman Khan has always gotten into the skin of Vivek Oberoi with his statements. A video of him passing comments on his fellow celebrity in his show \u201810 Ka Dum\u2018 is going viral.\n\nIn the video, recalled him telling guests, former cricketers Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj suffering a hamstring injury on the sets. Harbhajan Singh asked if he injured himself chasing Vivek Oberoi.\n\nVivek Oberoi started his Bollywood career with the 2001 movie \u201cCompany\u201c. He worked in films \u2018Saathiya\u2018, \u2018Darna Mana Hai\u2018, \u2018Kyun! Ho Gaya Na\u2026\u2018, \u2018Kaal\u2018, \u2018Deewane Huye Paagal\u2018, \u2018Omkara\u2018, \u2018Fool n Final\u2018, \u2018Rakta Charitra I\u2018, \u2018Rakta Charitra II\u2018, \u2018Zila Ghaziabad\u2018, \u2018Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story\u2018, \u2018Krrish 3\u2018 and others.",
