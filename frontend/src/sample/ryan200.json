      "text": "A new year, a new list of reasons to eat popcorn. Here are some of the notable movies that will be gracing the multiplexes in this year; note that movie release dates are subject to change.\n\nThose fond of Channing Tatum\u2019s particular brand of snake-hipped charm (check out how he hilariously stole \u201cThe Lost City\u201d in 2022) won\u2019t want to miss Steven Soderbergh\u2019s final film in his male-entertainer (don\u2019t call them strippers) trilogy, as Tatum\u2019s Mike tries to train a new group of dancers for one last hurrah. (Feb. 10)\n\nCostume drama alert! Kelvin Harrison Jr. plays Joseph Bologne, a real-life Black composer who rose to unlikely heights in 18th-century French society, including having a relationship with Marie Antoinette (Lucy Boynton). Stephen Williams, whose television work includes \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cWatchmen,\u201d directs. (April 7)\n\nI\u2019d imagine Taika Waititi (\u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows,\u201d \u201cReservation Dogs\u201d) might be pretty good at a sports comedy? This one follows the American Samoa soccer team, known as the world\u2019s worst after a 31-0 FIFA loss, as they take on a charismatic new coach (Michael Fassbender). (April 21)\n\n\u2018Are You There God? It\u2019s Me Margaret\u2019\n\nI grew up with this Judy Blume book; maybe you did too? It\u2019s finally a movie, with Abby Ryder Fortson (Cassie in the \u201cAnt-Man\u201d movies) as Margaret, Rachel McAdams as her mother and Kathy Bates as Grandma Sylvia. (April 28)\n\nNeed I say anything other than this title? And that Helen Mirren AND Rita Moreno are in this one? This franchise always promises fast cars, slow talking and good fun. (May 19)\n\nHalle Bailey stars in this live-action version of the beloved animated Disney musical, with a supporting cast that sounds pretty swell: Melissa McCarthy, Javier Bardem, Daveed Diggs and Awkwafina. (May 26)\n\nMiles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) returns for a long-awaited sequel to the acclaimed 2018 animated adventure \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\u201d Yes, the title\u2019s a little boring but the movie should be slick. (June 2)\n\nSpeaking of slick, here we have the latest \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d installment, apparently so full of plot and Tom-Cruise-trying-to-get-himself-killed that it had to be split into two parts. The usual suspects \u2014 Cruise, Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby \u2014 will all be on hand; Christopher McQuarrie directs. (July 14)\n\nOK, I\u2019ve raised my eyebrows at this one too, but this is written and directed by Greta Gerwig (\u201cLittle Women,\u201d \u201cLady Bird\u201d) so there\u2019s definitely a benefit-of-the-doubt factor. So yes, this is a movie based on the life of a famous fashion doll, played by Margot Robbie, with Ryan Gosling as Ken. We shall see! (July 21)\n\nNot your typical summer-movie fare, but potentially fascinating: Christopher Nolan directs a biopic about American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was known as the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb.\u201d Cillian Murphy plays the title role; also on hand are Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr., Gary Oldman and Rami Malek. (July 21)\n\nNia DaCosta (\u201cCandyman\u201d) directs this sequel to 2019\u2019s \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d with Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, Iman Vellani and Samuel L. Jackson. And I\u2019m hoping for a triumphant return of Goose the Cat. (July 28)\n\nKenneth Branagh returns as Detective Hercule Poirot in his third Agatha Christie adaptation, this one taking place in post-World War II Venice and featuring Kelly Reilly, Michelle Yeoh, Tina Fey and Jamie Dornan. (Sept. 15)\n\nGareth Edwards, director of \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u201d returns with a science-fiction love story featuring John David Washington, Gemma Chan, Allison Janney and Ken Watanabe. (Oct. 6)\n\nI know it feels like the last \u201cDune\u201d was just a few weeks ago, but nonetheless here\u2019s the sequel, directed by Denis Villeneuve and featuring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem. (Nov. 3)\n\nThank you, universe, for recognizing that it\u2019s been a tough couple of years, and that we all need a new \u201cChicken Run\u201d movie from the stop-motion wizards at Aardman Animations. David Fowler, Imelda Staunton and Bella Ramsey are among the voice talent. (Nov. 10)\n\nDo we need another \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d movie? Apparently we do! This one features Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Willy Wonka, with a supporting cast that includes Sally Hawkins, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Colman and Rowan Atkinson (Dec. 15)\n\nFirst it was an acclaimed novel by Alice Walker, then it was a Steven Spielberg movie, then it was a hit Broadway musical, and now it\u2019s a movie of the musical, starring Fantasia, Colman Domingo, Taraji P. Henson and H. E.R. Spielberg, Quincy Jones and Oprah Winfrey are among the producers; Blitz Bazawule (\u201cBlack Is King\u201d) directs. (Dec. 20)",

The flick will also star Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Stephanie Hsu.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary: Based on the 1980s adventure television series, the movie will center on a battered and past-his-prime stuntman who finds himself back on a movie with the star he worked with long ago and who replaced him. The problem, however, is that the star is now missing.\n\nRyan, Stephanie and Aaron were spotted on the set just a few months ago.

      "text": "The search for the next James Bond has been pretty quiet since Daniel Craig wrapped up his tenure with 2021's No Time to Die, but it sounds like things are heating up. The AV Club cites a handful of sources (The Sun, Puck News, The Mail On Sunday) in an article claiming that Aaron Taylor-Johnson has emerged as the frontrunner to take over as the new 007.\n\nYou may remember him as the title character in Kick-Ass, or as Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron, or maybe from last summer's Bullet Train. The story picking up steam says that Taylor-Johnson has met with longtime Bond producer Barbara Broccoli and that the meeting went really well. The first rumblings of this seem to have started in November, when The Sun reported that the actor had impressed producers in a \"secret audition.\" Eon Productions is said to be aiming for a reinvention of the iconic super-spy, but the article notes that Aaron Taylor-Johnson meets the classic new 007 requirements...he's male, he's British, and he's in his thirties. This is far from a lock, but the only other candidate mentioned in the piece is Emily in Paris actor Lucien Laviscount.\n\nTaylor-Johnson definitely has action chops. He beefed up and underwent tactical training to play a special ops commander in Christopher Nolan's TENET and recently took on tons of stunt work and fight choreography for his role as an assassin in Bullet Train. Check out the clip below of one of his Bullet Train fight scenes with Brad Pitt, but look out for some pretty salty language.\n\nUp next for Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a starring role in the Sony Spider-Man spinoff Kraven The Hunter and co-starring with Ryan Gosling in a movie version of The Fall Guy. Time will tell if he gets to slip on the tux as our new 007 after that.",

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Damien Chazelle will be recognized with the Advanced Imaging Society\u2019s Gene Kelly Visionary Award at the 13th\u00a0annual Lumiere Awards, taking place at The Beverly Hills Hotel on February 10.\n\nAIS\u2019 honor will be bestowed upon the Babylon filmmaker by Kelly\u2019s widow and biographer, Patricia Ward Kelly. Chazelle is only the second-ever recipient of the award, following Guillermo del Toro, who claimed the inaugural prize last year.\u00a0He will be honored at the Advanced Imagining Society\u2019s awards luncheon along with Avatar: The Way of Water collaborators James Cameron and Jon Landau, who were set last month to receive the Voices For the Earth Award.\n\nSaid AIS President, Jim Chabin: \u201cDamien Chazelle, like Gene Kelly, is an American original whose films burst with unbounded wit, intelligence and style, which he aptly demonstrates as he retells Hollywood\u2019s earliest days as it moved from silent films to talkies in his latest work, Babylon. We are thrilled to have this opportunity to honor him this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamien\u2019s passion about movies and music certainly links him with Gene [Kelly]. But so do his brightness, his pursuit of excellence, his fine vision, and his determination to forge new ground,\u201d added Patricia Ward Kelly. \u201cSoon after I met Damien, it was clear to me that he did, indeed, wish to learn as much as he could, and would be a stellar candidate for this award. Frankly, I look forward to seeing anything Damien does! I am extremely proud to present him with the Gene Kelly Visionary Award at the 2023 Lumiere Awards.\u201d\n\nChazelle is an Academy Award-winner and three-time nominee whose most recent film Babylon, released by Paramount on\u00a0December 23, has thus far scored\u00a0nine Critics Choice Award nominations and five from the Golden Globes, among other accolades. The more than three-hour epic written and directed by Chazelle traces the rise and fall of stars new (Margot Robbie) and old (Brad Pitt), and of an aspiring entertainment exec (Diego Calva) during an era of unbridled decadence and depravity in early Hollywood.\u00a0Marc Platt, Matthew Plouffe, and Olivia Hamilton served as the pic\u2019s producers.\n\nChazelle broke out as a filmmaker with the 2014 drumming drama Whiplash, starring Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons, which won three Oscars, as well as the original musical La La Land, led by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, which netted six, leading Chazelle to become the youngest winner of Best Director in history, at age 32. Additional directing credits for the celebrated multi-hyphenate include the 2018 NASA drama First Man for Universal, the 2020 Netflix series The Eddy and the 2009 indie Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench.\n\nFormed by senior Hollywood execs to identify game-changing filmmaking technologies and foster their deployment, the Advanced Imaging Society has presented the Lumiere Awards to the industry\u2019s most respected creative and technical leaders over the course of the last decade.\u00a0In addition to awards for motion pictures, episodic and new media content, the Society bestows awards for best musical motion picture, best musical scene or performance, best immersive audio and more. In addition to its annual awards, the Society produces The Insiders Show podcast and The Remote Control video series, with active chapters in China, India and Japan.",

The actor made his Hollywood debut with the Anthony and Joe Russo-directed action spectacle, which premiered on Netflix on July 22. Dhanush posted an audio clip on Instagram, in which he delivers a stern warning to Hollywood star Ryan Gosling\u2019s CIA mercenary Court Gentry aka Sierra Six. \u201cSix, This is Lone Wolf. I hear we are both looking for the same man. I want to offer you some advice. Stop looking. You are wasting your time. Because if I find him first, there will be nothing for you to look for. And if you find him first, then I will find you. Nothing personal,\u201d he said in the clip.\n\nAlongside the audio clip, Dhanush wrote, \u201cThe Gray Man universe is expanding and the sequel is coming\u2026 Lone Wolf is ready, are you?\u201d\n\nThe Gray Man is based on Mark Greaney\u2019s 2009 novel of the same name. It follows CIA mercenary spy Sierra Six, played by Ryan Gosling, being searched by his former colleague Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans). The spy action entertainer featured Ryan Gosling, Dhanush, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Rege Jean Page and Jessica Henwick. Netflix and The Russo Brothers have announced a spin-off movie as well which will explore different elements of the original film\u2019s universe. \u201cThe audience reaction to The Gray Man has been nothing short of phenomenal. We are so appreciative of the enthusiasm that fans across the world have had for this film. With so many amazing characters in the movie, we had always intended for the Gray Man to be part of an expanded universe, and we are thrilled that Netflix is announcing a sequel with Ryan, as well as a second script that we\u2019re excited to talk about soon,\u201d the Russo Brothers said in a joint statement.\n\nThe filmmaker duo, known for Marvel blockbusters like Captain America: Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, will return as directors for the sequel, which will be penned by Stephen McFeely. The spin-off film will be written by screenwriters Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese.",

I enjoy maintaining the opportunity to surprise myself, to surprise an audience, to keep your artistic juices flowing.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Gosling\u2019s most talked about role since The Notebook sees him star as Ken in the big-screen adaptation of Barbie.\n\nPictures of him rollerblading alongside Aussie co-star Margot Robbie as Barbie recently lit up gossip sites.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve never had more fun making a film than I did on Barbie,\u201d Gosling says.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for people to see it - whatever people think it is, it\u2019s not that, and I\u2019m just so excited to share it with everyone, and share the Kenergy!\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are feeling the Kenergy and I\u2019m glad Ken\u2019s story is going to be told.\u201d\n\nThe Gray Man is available on Netflix from Friday July 22",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nLooking for the perfect new book to take with you on summer vacation, or to take you away from it all when you're on a staycation? Culled from the ranks of Amazon's bestselling books, here's a list of recommended 2022 beach reads that'll have you turning pages in no time. We're talking everything from \"Book Lovers,\" the latest novel from Emily Henry, to \"The Office BFFs: Tales of 'The Office' from Two Best Friends Who Were There,\" a chatty, behind-the-scenes look at \"The Office\" by series stars Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, to the acclaimed Viola Davis memoir, \"Finding Me.\"\n\n'The Office BFFs: Tales of The Office from Two Best Friends Who Were There' (Kindle), $15\n\nAll of the 2022 beach reads recommended below are available to buy now through Amazon. Save for one as-yet unpublished book from John Grisham, all are rated 4 stars ratings or higher by Amazon users. (The Grisham title, \"Sparring Partners,\" doesn't yet have a posted rating.)\u00a0 All of the books are available in either hardcover or paperback (and maybe both!), and for the Kindle e-reader. (To make your summer beach reads beach-safe, check out our Essentials guide to\u00a0waterproof Kindle e-readers.)\n\nRead on to find out what to read in 2022! And be sure to go all the way to the end, where we'll share our past summer beach-read favorites with you.\n\nIf you love \"The Office,\" Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey's podcast, \"Office Ladies,\" or both, then you'll want to pack a copy of this book with your summer gear. Fischer and Kinsey's \"The Office BFFs: Tales of 'The Office' from Two Best Friends Who Were There,\" published in May 2022, is their eyewitness, behind-the-scenes account of the making of the beloved U. S. version of \"The Office.\"\n\n'The Office BFFs: Tales of The Office from Two Best Friends Who Were There' (Kindle), $15\n\n'The Office BFFs: Tales of The Office from Two Best Friends Who Were There' (hardcover), $19\n\nThis 2022 novel is so perfect for a day at the beach it may as well be a basket lunch. For one thing, \"Book Lovers\" is by Emily Henry, the author who literally wrote a book called \"Beach Read\" (as well as \"People We Meet on Vacation\"). For another thing, it's got a cover blurb by another 21st century queen of the beach read, Taylor Jenkins Reid (\"Daisy Jones & the Six,\"\u00a0\"Malibu Rising\"). For a third thing, Amazon users rate it 4.6 out of 5 stars.\n\nHenry's \"People We Meet on Vacation\" was one of our previous beach-read favorites, so be sure to keep scrolling down to find out more about that one. And, rest assured, we are nowhere near done name-checking Taylor Jenkins Reid.\n\nOscar-winning actress Viola Davis (\"Fences\") tells her story, as she writes, \"from a crumbling apartment in Central Falls, Rhode Island, to the stage in New York City, and beyond.\" Published in 2022, and an Oprah's Book Club selection, \"Finding Me\" boasts a 4.8-star rating on Amazon.\n\nGolf journalist Alan Shipnuck didn't just write a biography of Phil Mickelson, his release of Mickelson quotes about the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League upended the sport star's career. So, if you're curious about the three-time Masters champ known as Lefty, or if you want to indulge in \"one outrageous story [after] another,\" as Golfweek put it, then you're going to want to stuff Shipnuck's \"Phil\" in your beach bag -- or, yes, golf bag. The book was published in 2022.\n\n\"Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized!) Biography of Golf's Most Colorful Superstar\" (Kindle), $15\n\n\"Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized!) Biography of Golf's Most Colorful Superstar\" (hardcover), $19\n\nYes, John Grisham fans are getting new John Grisham. \"Sparring Partners,\" due to be published May 31, 2022, but on sale now, is billed as the first collection of novellas from the superstar writer of legal thrillers such as \"The Firm\" and \"The Client.\" One of the book's three new tales, \"Homecoming,\" features the popular Grisham character Jake Brigance, the hero of \"A Time to Kill\" and more.\n\nWell, we told you we'd return to the subject of Taylor Jenkins Reid, and here we are. While we could just as easily be writing here about the author's \"Daisy Jones & the Six\" (soon to be an Amazon Prime series) or\u00a0\"Malibu Rising\"\u00a0(featured below, and, oh, by the way, in development at Hulu), we're spotlighting the faux Hollywood tale\u00a0\"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\"\u00a0because, despite being published in 2017, the novel is having a moment in Amazon's bestselling rankings. And, oh, yes, it's being adapted by Netflix. So, basically, read some Reid this summer so you know what you're going to binge-watch maybe next summer.\n\n\"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel\" (Kindle), $15\n\n\"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel\" (paperback), $9\n\nOriginally published in 2018, Delia Owens' \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" is another title, like Taylor Jenkins Reid's \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,\" that just keeps going and going in Amazon's bestseller rankings. A murder mystery set in North Carolina in 1969, \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" is rated 4.8 stars by Amazon users. Hollywood's a fan, too. A big-screen adaptation with Daisy Edgar-Jones (\"Normal People') is due out in July 2022.\n\nHere's a look at books we've previously highlighted as being perfect for reads for the summer season. They may not be brand new, but they're timeless -- and they're available to buy right now on Amazon.\n\nThis Reese's Book Club pick, written by Lucy Foley, is a murder mystery set at a wedding on an island off the coast of Ireland. The book is filled with intrigue and revealed secrets. You'll meet the bride, the groom, the plus one, the best man, the wedding planner, the bridesmaid and more, but don't get too attached -- before you know it, one of them will turn up dead in \"The Guest List.\"\n\nEven before this tale from Laura Dave (\"The Divorce Party\") was published, Reese Witherspoon and her production company snapped up the rights. (Julia Roberts signed on to star in its series adaptation for Apple TV+. ) \"The Last Thing He Told Me\" is the story of a woman, her teen step-daughter -- and a husband who goes missing. Vogue called the novel \"light and bright, despite its edgy plot.\"\n\n\"The Last Thing He Told Me\" (Kindle), $14\n\n\"The Last Thing He Told Me\" (hardcover), $14\n\nGlennon Doyle's \"Untamed\"\u00a0was published in 2020. The New York Times-bestselling memoir has had celebrities from Reese Witherspoon to Oprah Winfrey raving about it. The emotional page-turner tells the empowering story of Doyle's self-discovery. Find out what happens when she leaves discontentment behind in favor of living her truth.\n\nIs there a genre that's more escapist than sci-fi? If you're looking for an out-of-this-world trip this summer,  then \"Project Hail Mary\" may be your ticket. The novel by Andy Weir (\"The Martian\") is about a man who wakes up on a spaceship with no idea why he's there, or who he is. Like other books in this rundown, \"Project Hail Mary\" is bound for Hollywood: Ryan Gosling is set to star in the big-screen version.\n\nThis novel by Tia Williams (\"The Accidental Diva\") seems custom-made for beach readers. Not only is \"Seven Days in June\" set in the summer, it's set in the world of books, too. The tale of two authors reconnecting after a long-ago, teenage fling was hailed as \"[o]ne of the most anticipated romance novels of the summer\" by Oprah Daily.\n\nIn \"Malibu Rising,\" Taylor Jenkins Reid spins a story that's set primarily in 1983, and concerns a Southern California family, a house party -- and a raging wildfire. Praised Publishers Weekly: \"This page-turning indulgence hits the spot.\"\n\nThis novel by Steven Rowley (\"Lily and the Octopus\") was named one of the Washington Post's \"[f]eel-good books to brighten your summer.\" In it, Patrick, known to his young niece and nephew as Gay Uncle Patrick, or GUP, unexpectedly becomes the caretaker to the two tykes. \"Rowley's depth and humor will warm even the most jaded hearts,\" the Post judged in 2021.\n\nIn \"one of 2021's must-read novels,\" per Bustle, author Nghi Vo (\"The Empress of Salt and Fortune\") reimagines \"The Great Gatsby\" from the perspective of Jordan Baker. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, Jordan is a white southerner who bewitches Nick Carroway. In \"The Chosen and the Beautiful,\" she's a queer Vietnamese adoptee. \"Did we mention the book also mixes in magical realism?\" USA Today asked. (USA Today did -- and the book does.)\n\n\"The Chosen and the Beautiful\" (Kindle), $12\n\n\"The Chosen and the Beautiful\" (hardcover), $17\n\nThis debut novel by Zakiya Dalila Harris generated tons of buzz upon its 2021 release. It draws from Harris' former workaday life at a top publishing house. Billed as a thriller, the novel tells the story of Nella, a 26-year-old editorial assistant at (wait for it) a top publishing house. Nella is the only Black staffer in the otherwise all-white team until Hazel comes on board -- and complications ensue. \"Harris's writing propels you forward through the story,\" the New York Times said.\n\n\"The Ugly Cry\" is Danielle Henderson's story of growing up, as the book's\u00a0publisher puts it, \"Black, weird, and overwhelmingly uncool in a mostly white neighborhood in upstate New York.\" Henderson, who was raised by her grandmother, is a TV writer (\"Maniac\") and podcaster (\"I Saw What You Did\"). Her memoir is, the Associated Press declared, \"powerful and energetic.\"\n\nAnother popular Emily Henry title, \"People We Meet on Vacation\"\u00a0is about two longtime friends, Alex and Poppy, who resume their once-annual ritual of summering together. The Wall Street Journal called out Henry's \"laugh-out-loud funny\" dialogue.\n\n\"Tiger Girl and the Candy Kid\" is a tome by veteran author Glenn Stout about Jazz Age baddies Margaret and Richard Whittemore, aka the \"original gangster couple\" of the book's subtitle. \"Stout has done more than simply chronicle the couple's crimes,\" Tina Jordan wrote of the book for the New York Times. \"He has tried to understand what motivated the Whittemores.\"\n\nA classic beach-reading experience demands a classic beach read -- or two. Whether you're re-reading Kevin Kwan's mammoth 2013 hit,\u00a0\"Crazy Rich Asians,\"\u00a0for the 100th time, or reading it for the first time (after seeing the hit movie for the 100th time), you'll be swept into the craziness that is the romance of Rachel Chu and Nick Young.\n\nJacqueline Susann's passionate, and passionately written, \"Valley of the Dolls\" was first published in 1966. Set in the post-World War II New York City, it's a tale of three young women with big dreams, and occasionally big drug problems. Summed up Nancy Bachrach once\u00a0for NPR, \"'Valley of the Dolls' is a zipper-ripper that has been called trashy, tawdry, glitzy, lusty, sordid and seamy -- and that's just the beginning of its appeal.\"\n\n* The best cooking shows to stream right now\n\n* The best TV and movies to stream this week\n\n* Family streaming guide: New shows and movies that the whole family will enjoy\n\n* What's new on Apple TV Plus this month",

So, the Netflix team is doing a special launch event for fans to celebrate the premiere over at SDCC.\n\nHead outside the convention center to undergo The Gray Man Training Program. It\u2019s an interactive escape experience set on a tram car, inspired by the chase scene in the new film. You\u2019ll encounter different obstacles and special effects as part of your timed mission. Here\u2019s the official description of The Gray Man Training Program from Netflix:\n\nOnce aboard the tram, fans will have to prove they have what it takes to become the next Gray Man in a test of skill, strength, and speed while transporting a top secret file to safety before the mercenaries catch up and the time runs out. The heart pounding mission will include various obstacles and special effects, and will culminate in a rooftop sprint as fans race against the clock to complete the mission. Fans will leave with a badass customized social takeaway that puts them at the center of their own action film.\n\nYou can find The Gray Man Training Program at the ABM Parking Lot on the corner of First Ave. and Island Ave. The experience will be open Thursday \u2013 Saturday from 10am \u2013 7pm, and Sunday 11am \u2013 4pm.\n\nInside the San Diego Convention Center you can also get your Gray Man fix.

Beset with car and man trouble \u2013 her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is due for release from prison, and she is not sure how she feels about that \u2013 Irene is happy for the distraction and attention her neighbour offers her and her son, Benicio (Kaden Leos).\n\nWhen he finally does come home, there's naturally a tension between Standard and his wife's new acquaintance, but it's put aside when Standard receives an unfriendly visit with unreasonable demands \u2013 he must fulfil one last job, or his family will face the consequences.\n\nEager to prevent that, the driver offers his services, much to Shannon's annoyance.\n\nRyan Gosling's nameless hero is also a man of few words in a film where dialogue itself is spare, but telling, while the acts of violence, although rare, are bloody, brutal and wince-inducing.\n\nDrive harks back to the stylish action-thrillers of the early 1980s. Think To Live and Die in LA-meets-Sudden Impact, by way of Death Wish II and The Hunter. But unlike some of those, along with the style, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (whose later works included The Neon Demon and Only God Forgives) delivers substance.\n\nDon't be fooled by the trailers which suggested this might have been the next Fast and the Furious. This is a dark, brooding, slow-burning, blood-spattered tale that's closer to The Professional, A History of Violence, Collateral or the 25th Hour, than The Transporter.\n\nForget pithy one-liners. Gosling's nameless hero is also a man of few words in a film where dialogue itself is spare, but telling, while the acts of violence, although rare, are bloody, brutal and wince-inducing.\n\nWorking from Hossain Amini's compelling, \"driving\" narrative script, director Refn delivers a masterclass in mood creation, playing with camera angles, shadows, film speed and sound to keep the audience fully engrossed.\n\nIt also helps that he had assembled one of the dream casts of 2011. Gosling (then fresh off Crazy, Stupid, Love) is a revelation as the driver whose genial demeanour hides a coldish heart of controlled aggression and don't-argue authority.\n\nHe is admirably supported by a supporting cast that includes the luminous Mulligan (An Education, The Great Gatsby) and an almost unrecognisable \u2013 both physically and character-wise \u2013 Brooks (Broadcast News), as well as some of the stars of the most popular current TV dramas \u2013 Cranston (Breaking Bad), Ron Perlman (Sons of Anarchy) and Christina Hendricks (Mad Men).\n\nEven 10 years on, this is one of the best exemplars of cinema as a modern, immersive, innovative storytelling art form.\n\nDrive is now available to rent from iTunes, GooglePlay, YouTube, AroVision and Academy OnDemand.",

      "text": "Kid Sister begins streaming at midday on Thursday, May 26 on TVNZ OnDemand.\n\nREVIEW: While the spectres of the comedic stylings of Rose Matafeo, Lena Dunham\u2019s Girls and most notably Emma Seligman\u2019s sublime Shiva Baby hang over TVNZ\u2019s latest Kiwi comedy, it is notable for providing juicy, surprising roles for two screen veterans.\n\nNew York-based Kiwi Simone Nathan might be the creator and star of Kid Sister, but Amanda Billing and Peter Hayden steal the show as a South African-born \u201cJewish mother\u201d and an outrageous family patriarch respectively.\n\nWhile proud of her Jewish heritage, 29-year-old Aucklander Lulu Emanuel (Nathan) could do without some of the expectations that brings. Fending off all attempts to marry her off to \u201csome nice Jewish boy\u201d, she has to navigate her on/off relationship with gentile Ollie (Paul Williams) essentially in secret.\n\nEvery family gathering has become a tortuous affair, as everyone has an opinion on how best to solve her \u201cproblem\u201d \u2013 from American importation to \u2013 Jehovah forbid \u2013 finding someone outside the faith willing to, as Lulu elegantly puts it, \u201cget the old salami koshered\u201d. And, besides, she\u2019s having issues with her own body anyway, a persistent UTI causing her to feel like she\u2019s \u201cpissing out a ghost pepper\u201d.\n\nSimone Nathan is the creator of NZ's first sitcom about and by a Jewish\u00a0Kiwi.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* The Thing About Pam: Renee Zellweger's controversial transformation hits Amazon\n\n* Miriam and Alan: Lost in Scotland: Welcome to the most hilarious travel show on TV\n\n* The Love Guru: If you thought Netflix's Pentaverate was Mike Myers' lowpoint...\n\nAs she confides to us, \u201cthe only thing more painful would be if my parents found out who I was actually dating right now\u201d.\n\nFortunately that\u2019s not the only issue currently preoccupying the family. Mother Keren (Billing) is avoiding the rabbi in order to save her beloved black Zambezi dress from being sacrificed as part of a holy tradition, while a nurse (Angella Dravid) has finally revealed Hershey\u2019s (Hayden) guilty little secret \u2013 he\u2019s been \u201cspreading chlamydia like the plague\u201d through his rest home.\n\nKid Sister shines the spotlight on the talented Simone Nathan, but Peter Hayden, right, is one of the show\u2019s big scene stealers.\n\nNathan has clearly picked up some skills from working with Amy Schumer (Inside Amy Schumer) and Taika Waititi (Our Flag Means Death), while developing her own voice. This is a confident, bold debut full of chutzpah that deserves to find an audience, both among \u201cinsiders\u201d and Kiwis from all walks of life.\n\nSome of the humour may be a little too edgy for certain demographics, but that probably explains its online debut.\n\nMeet the Emanuels \u2013 the Auckland Jewish family at the centre of Kid Sister.\n\nNathan clearly has a unique Kiwi perspective, plenty to say and a smart, zesty, frank way of expressing it, even if it\u2019s her co-stars who get all the best lines.\n\nKid Sister begins streaming on TVNZ OnDemand at midday on Thursday, May 26.",

And starring alongside Tatum is Salma Hayek Pinault (\u201cHouse of Gucci,\u201d \u201cHitman\u2019s Wife\u2019s Bodyguard\u201d).\n\n\u201cMagic\u201d Mike Lane (Tatum) takes to the stage again after a lengthy hiatus, following a business deal that went bust, leaving him broke and taking bartender gigs in Florida. For what he hopes will be one last hurrah, Mike heads to London with a wealthy socialite (Hayek Pinault) who lures him with an offer he can\u2019t refuse\u2026and an agenda all her own. With everything on the line, once Mike discovers what she truly has in mind, will he\u2014and the roster of hot new dancers he\u2019ll have to whip into shape\u2014be able to pull it off?\n\n* Also starring with Tatum and Hayek Pinault are Ayub Khan Din (\u201cAckley Bridge\u201d), newcomer Jemelia George, Juliette Motamed (\u201cWe Are Lady Parts\u201d) and Vicki Pepperdine (\u201cJohnny English Strikes Again\u201d).\n\n* Soderbergh\u2019s creative team behind the scenes includes production designer Pat Campbell (\u201cThe Bastard Son & The Devil Himself\u201d)\n\n* Choreography by Alison Faulk and Luke Broadlick, both part of the \u201cMagic Mike\u201d franchise.\n\nA Warner Bros.

      "text": "Gangster Squad is now available to stream on TVNZ OnDemand.\n\nIt's easy to see why the events of Aurora, Colorado, delayed this film's release by four months in 2013.\n\nFor while its most potentially controversial scene \u2013 a shoot- out in a cinema \u2013 was expunged, Reuben Fleisher's (Zombieland) blood-soaked crime drama certainly doesn't pull any punches when it comes to violence and gun play.\n\nIn this stylish-looking but stilted-sounding film, Los Angeles circa 1949 is a town awash with vice, corruption and death. Caught in the grip of crime boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), who has sworn an oath to violence, the City of Angels has truly become the wild west coast.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Line of Duty: Britain's best police procedural finds a welcome new home on TVNZ\n\n* National Treasures: TVNZ's show about our past offers a vision for the future\n\n* Six Angry Women: TVNZ's fascinating doco investigates one of our great mysteries\n\nBut with only a handful of \"good men\" on the force, not in the employ of Cohen, Chief Parker (Nick Nolte, sounding like he's had an extra helping of gravel for breakfast) decides to tap former war hero John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to assemble a squad of five or six to wage an off-the-books guerrilla war against Cohen. Their mission is to shatter his empire and drive him out of the city. However, Cohen certainly isn't going to give up his cash cow without a fight.\n\nWith its impressive art direction, varying film speeds, starry cast and sense of menace, this is clearly a crime film that wants to be LA Confidential or Brian De Palma's The Untouchables.\n\nEven the combined talents of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling can't save Gangster Squad.\n\nHowever, that's all undercut by Castle writer Will Beall's depressingly by-the-numbers script (you just know who's going to buy the farm, which cute moppet is going to be left orphaned and that when someone menacingly says \"you know the drill\" a power tool is going to be produced), tin-eared dialogue and cliched, cardboard cut-out characters who feel like they've been lifted from the pages of True Detective or Dick Tracy. That especially applies to Penn, whose awful prosthetics look like they were left over from the latter 1990 rubber-face fest.\n\nBrolin (Men In Black III) meanwhile is simply a square- jawed hero, Ryan Gosling (Drive) adds a baby-voice to his baby-face in playing Brolin's maverick, but sensitive partner, while the latter's Crazy, Sexy, Love co-star Emma Stone is wasted as a Jessica Rabbit-like gangster's moll. Then there's the token Hispanic, black, electronics-geek and sharp-shooting characters who make up the squad Oceans-esque half-dozen.\n\nMuch better, but criminally underused, is The Killing's Mireille Enos, who plays O'Mara's stoic, but sassy wife Connie. She is the voice of reason among all the carnage and vengeance (\"I don't need a hero, I need a husband,\" she barks at her constantly absent spouse) and it's just a pity she is given so little screen time.\n\nThe film's 2008 source book, written by newspaperman Paul Lieberman is a harrowing, hard-boiled tale, but in Fleisher's hands it loses its edge, sunk by some strangely light, albeit enjoyable comedic scenes revolving around the squad's less than successful early attempts at derailing Cohen's operations.\n\nSean Penn\u2019s awful prosthetics look like they were left over from 1990 rubber-face fest Dick Tracy.\n\nAt times more Mod than Gangster Squad, rather than being thrown into the pitched battle for the soul of Los Angeles, viewers are left watching a film tonally at war with itself.\n\nGangster Squad is now streaming on TVNZ OnDemand.",

According to Deadline, the new film, The Iron Claw, comes from A24 and writer-director Sean Durkin. It\u2019s all about the Von Erich family and their rise and fall. The Von Erichs were one of the most famous families in Professional Wrestling from the 1960s and on. They made a huge impact in the sport, rivaling the power of the McMahon family for a time, especially in the state of Texas.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown at the time which family member Efron is playing or what the time frame of the film is. Either way, it\u2019s a great time to be a wrestling fan between WWE, All Elite Wrestling, and New Japan Pro Wrestling lighting the world aflame. The Iron Claw isn\u2019t like anything else that Efron has done in his career, so it should be a nice challenge for him.\n\nFor more on Wrestling or Movie News, make sure to check back to That Hashtag Show.",

      "text": "Universal Pictures is making big moves for its Wolfman film. Ryan Gosling is reportedly set to star in the lead role.\n\nGosling will also serve as a producer. Jason Blum\u2019s Blumhouse production banner has also boarded the project.\n\nThe treatment for the film comes from Leigh Whannell. The story will be based on both the 1941 Wolfman film and an original idea of Whannell\u2019s.\n\nThe official script will be penned by Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo (Orange is the New Black).\n\nWhannell has a first look deal with Blumhouse, and has collaborated with the company on seven previous projects, including The Invisible Man. Apparently, Whannell and Gosling have wanted to work together for a while now.\n\nWolfman is part of Universal Picture\u2019s effort to bring back classic movie monsters. The studio wanted to remake classic horror films featuring monsters like the Wolfman and Frankenstein.\n\nThe studio\u2019s first effort in the Classic Movie Monsters program failed spectacularly with 2017\u2019s The Mummy starring Tom Cruise. Not only did the film flop at the box office, it was widely derided by critics. (It stands at only 16% on Rotten Tomatoes.)\n\nWhile it may be unfair to judge Wolfman at such an early stage, my hopes aren\u2019t high. It seems like Universal is relying on the same tactics they used for The Mummy; the focus is on grabbing a big-name actor for the lead role and hoping audiences tune in for him. Ryan Gosling as the Wolfman? That feels like a bizarre choice.\n\nUndoubtedly Universal also hopes bringing Blumhouse into the mix will make Wolfman a success. The recent Blumhouse-Whannell collaboration The Invisible Man certainly succeeded both financially and critically. But will it be enough to turn Wolfman into a hit?\n\nWhat do you think about Ryan Gosling as the Wolfman? Do you think Blumhouse can make Universal\u2019s Classic Movie Monsters push a success? Let us know in the comments.\n\nFor more on the latest horror flicks, be sure to check back to That Hashtag Show.",

After hoovering up the rose petals and rescuing her bra from the aquarium, Maya makes her escape \u2013 just in time.\n\nOnce she arrives at work, he apologises for the short notice and promises that he has hired a lawyer to begin divorce proceedings.\n\n\u201cI want to be with you, I\u2019ve been sleeping in the basement on the pool table for a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why I am I still getting Christmas cards of your family?\u201d Maya retorts.\n\nKudos to Four Weddings and a Funeral\u2019s casting director, who managed to gather together a terrific ensemble of fresh talent for the series.\n\nHowever, with Ted (Tommy Dewey), an aspiring senator and her boss, currently leading the polls, the political speech-writer knows he won\u2019t be making any rash decisions for some time.\n\nFortunately, she has something else to focus on in the short term. A flying visit to London to see her old college friends Ainsley (Rebecca Rittenhouse), Craig (Brandon Mychal Smith) and Duffy (John Reynolds).\n\nThings though, don\u2019t start well, when she picks up the wrong luggage from the Heathrow carousel. Her unlikely rescuer is a baggage handler\u2019s son, Anglo-Pakistani investment banker Kash (Starstruck\u2019s Nikesh Patel), who Maya finds not only easy to talk to (even if they vehmently disagree over the merits of the movie version of Mamma Mia!), but looks like \u201cRyan Gosling dipped in caramel\u201d.\n\nBut, as the centrepiece of the weekend \u2013 Ainsley\u2019s rom-com costume party \u2013 gets underway, it\u2019s someone else who is desperate to get Maya\u2019s attention. Duffy has waited a decade to declare his love and now he\u2019s broken out the Lloyd Dobler costume and ghetto-blaster in preparation.\n\nMeanwhile, Craig is distracted by a series of texts from someone he encountered years ago and Ainsley is desperate for Maya to meet the man who has stolen her heart. However, Maya\u2019s heart sinks when he\u2019s revealed to be someone she never expected to see again \u2013 Kash.\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral - the movie - debuted in 1994.\n\nCreated by the dynamic duo behind The Mindy Project \u2013 Mindy Kaling and Matt Warburton \u2013 Four Weddings and a Funeral is a surprisingly gorgeous and hilarious confection \u2013 one that probably could have done without the baggage and expectations created by the name.\n\nThat said, there is some fun to be had in seeing how they put a modern spin on similar situations and themes and the crisp writing results in some memorable set-pieces, especially a version of wedding-reading staple Corinthians that has to be seen \u2013 and heard \u2013 to be believed.\n\nKudos to the casting director as well, who has managed to gather together a terrific ensemble of fresh talent. You can see here why Rose Matafeo chose Patel to be her sparring partner for her own London-set rom-com series.\n\nThrow in a terrific soundtrack of modern covers of classic tunes (as well as the original Love is All Around) and the result is an addictive, charming series, that once dived into, you\u2019ll find you\u2019ll easily polish off in just a few evenings of \u2013 seemingly inevitable \u2013 binge-watching.\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral is now available to stream on TVNZ+.",

While he waits in hope of rescue, he begins receiving calls on a seemingly disconnected phone from his kidnapper\u2019s previous victims.\n\n\u201cPart Stranger Things, part The Lovely Bones, and part that urban myth that freaked you out when you were little, The Black Phone is a deliciously creepy throwback anchored by strong performances from both kids and adults alike,\u201d wrote National Post\u2019s Chris Knight.\n\nJohn Cho and Mia Isaac play father and daughter in Don\u2019t Make Me Go.\n\nShot in and around Auckland and Christchurch last winter, this familial drama focuses on the relationship between a single father and his teenage daughter.\n\nAfter discovering he has a terminal disease, the pair embark on a road trip to find her estranged mother. John Cho and Mia Isaac star.\n\nPolice Rescue and Wentworth star Leah Purcell wrote, directed and stars in this reimagining of Henry Lawson\u2019s 1892 short story. She plays a heavily pregnant mother-of-four who finds herself in a tight spot when an escaped convict (RFDS\u2019 Rob Collins) arrives at her homestead while her husband is away shifting their stock.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of The Nightingale and Sweet Country, this makes great use of the Australian countryside as a backdrop for some searing tension.\n\nRyan Gosling is back in action in The Gray Man.\n\nAvengers: Endgame and Infinity War helmers Joe and Anthony Russo direct and co-wrote this action-thriller based on a 2009 novel by Mark Greaney. Court Gentry is the CIA most-skilled mercenary, but when he accidentally uncovers dark agency secrets, he becomes the target of international assassins.\n\nTalia Ryder and Jordan Fisher\u2019s characters have plenty to ponder in Hello, Goodbye and Everything in Between.\n\nHello, Goodbye, and Everything in Between (July 6, Netflix)\n\nJennifer E.

Grant and Henry Golding.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the tale, it\u2019s the story of Anne Elliot, who eight years prior to the action was persuaded not to marry a dashing man of humble origins.

Mark Rylance and Sally Hawkins star.\n\n\u201cRylance's unassuming and twinkly eyed performance goes a long way to imbuing the film with a charm that elevates it above most crowd-pleasing fare,\u201d wrote Radio Times\u2019 Terry Staunton.\n\nA magical mix-tape is the key to Press Play.\n\nSci-fi-infused romance about a young woman who has a chance to save the love of her life, when she discovers that the mix-tape they made together can transport her back in time.\n\n\u201cHere is a movie that works almost entirely because of its commitment to a genuinely intriguing premise,\u201d wrote Spectrum Culture\u2019s Joe Copling.\n\nJoey King, Dominic Cooper and Olga Kurylenko star in this action fantasy about a strong-willed royal who must save her kingdom after the cruel sociopathic suitor she rejects becomes hell-bent on stealing her father\u2019s throne.\n\nVietnamese director Le-Van Kiet\u2019s background in marital-arts-based productions infuses itself into the story in the form of multiple fight scenes.\n\nA stowaway changes Jacob Holland's (Karl Urban) outlook on life in The Sea Beast.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s own Karl Urban voices legendary sea monster hunter Jacob Holland in this animated adventure from one of the co-director\u2019s of Moana \u2013 Chris Williams. Holland has an epiphany after a stowaway girl befriends the most dangerous monster of them all.\n\nThe vocal cast also includes Jared Harris, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Dan Stevens and Kathy Burke.\n\nThor: Love and Thunder welcomes back Natalie Portman to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nTaika Waititi returns to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with this Ragnarok follow-up, set in a post-Avengers: Endgame universe.\n\nNatalie Portman\u2019s Jane Foster returns, the Guardians of the Galaxy feature, while Christian Bale plays the infamous Gorr the God Butcher.

The cast also includes Luke Hemsworth, Radha Mitchell and the controversial Ezra Miller.\n\n\u201cAsking for It is too much like its cardboard heroines: edgy on the outside, empty within,\u201d wrote Variety magazine\u2019s Jessica Kiang.",

[USA], July 18 (ANI): 'Avengers: Endgame' writer-director duo -- Russo brothers -- are all set to bring actors Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans together for their new Netflix venture, a spy thriller 'The Gray Man', following the massive success of 'Extraction' on the online streaming platform.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the new project, based on the best-selling book of the same name by Mark Greaney, comes with a budget of a whopping USD 200 million.\n\nHelmed by Joe and Anthony Russo, famously known as the Russo brothers, the cinematic hunk-off will be bankrolled by their new content company AGBO. With 'The Gray Man', the director duo intends to create a new James Bond-level film franchise.\n\n\"The idea is to create a franchise and build out a whole universe. We have all committed to the first movie and that's got to be great to get us to the second movie. We think Netflix is the perfect place for this film,\" Joe told Deadline.\n\n\"These are master assassins, and Gosling's character gets burned by the CIA and Evans' character has to hunt him down,\" he added.\n\nBesides Joe, the script has also been penned by none other than the 'Captain America' and 'Avengers' screenwriters, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus.\n\n'The Gray Man' revolves around the story of an ex-CIA operative turned killer as he is pursued by an old colleague.\n\nPreviously, the Russo brothers collaborated with Netflix for the Chris Hemsworth starrer 'Extraction' which released earlier this year.

Here\u2019s the official synopsis from Netflix:\n\nWhen it\u2019s time for teenage vampire Juliette (Sarah Catherine Hook) to make her first kill so she can take her place among a powerful vampire family, she sets her sights on a new girl in town named Calliope (Imani Lewis). But much to Juliette\u2019s surprise, Calliope is a vampire hunter from a family of celebrated slayers. Both find that the other won\u2019t be so easy to kill and, unfortunately, way too easy to fall for.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s basically Buffy meets Killing Eve. [Insert Billy Eichner \u201cLet\u2019s go lesbians!\u201d gif here.]\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have a trailer yet, Netflix did release some first-look images of the series today.\n\nFirst Kill comes from creator, head writer, and executive producer Victoria \u201cV. E.\u201d Schwab. The series is based on Schwab\u2019s short story of the same name. Emma Roberts, Karah Preiss, and Jet Wilkinson also executive produce the series.

      "text": "In the lead up to Christmas, many Australians are looking to shop smarter and save every way they can.\n\nRewards programs can be a great way to do that, and now one of the biggest programs in the country is delivering a huge incentive.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Supersizing your Christmas shopping savings.\n\nWatch Sunrise on Channel 7 and stream it for free on 7plus >>\n\n\u201cThis is the first time ever we will be giving customers instant discounts on some of the most popular products just by swiping their Flybuys cards.\u201d\n\nThroughout November, Flybuys members will receive up to $10 off selected products.\n\nExpect savings on some of the most popular items in store, from cereal to juice, even meat.\n\n\u201cOne of the products I think will be the most popular is Australia\u2019s favourite dinner - the Coles RSPCA approved hot roast chook,\u201d Alpins said.\n\nIt comes as reward program members are being encouraged to make sure they\u2019re getting the most out of their spending.\n\n\u201cWe know that 86 per cent of Australians have at least one rewards scheme, but in many cases, they\u2019re doing nothing with it,\u201d Finder rewards points expert Angus Kidman told Sunrise.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re either not using those points at all or they\u2019re not using them in an intelligent way.\n\n\u201cIf you use your points, you really can save a lot of money, especially in the lead-up to Christmas.\u201d\n\nKidman says the best way to utilise the points you\u2019ve earned throughout the year is to put them towards Christmas travel.\n\n\u201cThe best value is actually using them for flights, so if you are planning travel for Christmas, or you want to give a gift of a holiday to someone, that\u2019s the best way to use those points.\n\nMother-of-four Emma Chidiac has been a Flybuys member since 1993, making the most of the savings on offer.\n\n\u201cI just activate all the offers that I get through emails,\u201d Chidiac told Sunrise.\n\nEmma has even gifted her rewards points to family members, and took a relative for a $1000 grocery shopping spree after winning bonus points.\n\nIf you\u2019ll be adding some bubbly festive cheer to your Christmas celebrations this year, it might be worth seeing what rewards bonuses are on offer.\n\n\u201cWe do see a lot of bonus point offers at bottle shops, and that can be really good when you\u2019re trying to stock up on the Christmas beers and the New Year\u2019s champagnes,\u201d Kidman explained.\n\n\u201cLook for those offers where they\u2019ll give you a few thousand extra points if you spend a bit of money at those chains - that can really help.\u201d\n\nWith household grocery spending being top of mind for many families across Australia, some are also turning to technology like the Shipping app, which helps compare prices across multiple supermarkets.\n\nOthers are using subscription services that offer bonus points with the two big supermarkets by paying a monthly fee.\n\n\u201cThey can be good value,\u201d Kidman said.\n\n\u201cYou can come out of those ahead, you need to crunch the numbers carefully.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re spending a lot at the supermarket every week anyway, then the chance to double or triple those points is definitely worth exploring.\u201d\n\nIt can be tempting to use your rewards program\u2019s online shop to redeem points for \u201cfree\u201d items, but Kidman advises that\u2019s the worst thing you can do.\n\n\u201cThe bad way is to use the points to buy items from those programs because you\u2019re not getting maximum value there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou really need to be strategic and not just waste those points buying an overpriced coffee machine from one of your rewards schemes, because that is not going to pay off.\u201d\n\n7NEWS.com.au has not received any monetary benefit from this content.",

What do you think we\u2019ll see in the second season of The Bad Batch.\u00a0What characters would you like to see make an appearance? Also what 2022 Star Wars Disney+ series are you the most excited about?\n\nYou can tell us your thoughts by leaving a comment below or finding me on Twitter @TheIndianaSlone.

      "text": "* The first episode of HBO's Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon leaked online before its TV debut.\n\n* Game of Thrones was the most-pirated TV show of the year globally for several years.\n\n* The 10-episode series is based on George RR Martin's book Fire & Blood and tells the story of House Targaryen.\n\nHBO's new Game of Thrones prequel drama series, House of the Dragon, leaked online over the weekend.\n\nThousands of people started torrenting, sharing and downloading the first episode of House of the Dragon on Saturday/early Sunday, almost 24 hours before it was set to make its TV debut. The versions are reportedly pristine high-definition (HD) 1080p, full surround sound with an HBO logo in the top-right corner and enabled subtitling in various languages.\n\nTV critics and journalists in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and some other countries like the Middle East were given access to digital screeners beforehand of the first six episodes for reviews which appeared last week, but those copies contain a digital watermark to identify which journalist it was sent to.\n\nHBO and M-Net (DStv 101), which will be carrying House of the Dragon in South Africa and across sub-Saharan Africa as an Express from the US, held two screening events on Friday for media after the review embargo had already lapsed.\n\nTwo weeks ago, TorrentFreak reported that HBO lawyers in California issued a stern DMCA takedown request for a Reddit post, after a Reddit user posted the plotline and episode synopsis, along with spoilers, on the platform.\n\nWhile the new TV series closely adhered to George R. R. Martin's Fire & Ice book, which is set 172 years before the events of Game of Thrones and tells the story of the fall of the House of Targaryen dynasty, viewers don't know which events, characters and what dragons will be featured in what episodes, which is spoiled in the episode synopsis and plot outlines.\n\nThe later seasons of Game of Thrones, including almost all of the episodes of the widely-panned 8th and final season, were also leaked online. Game of Thrones was the most-pirated TV show of the year globally for several years.\n\nHBO's House of the Dragon and Amazon Prime Video's upcoming fantasy drama series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power which will debut in September and is billed as the most expensive TV show ever made, are both very strong contenders to make 2022's list of most-pirated TV shows this year.",

      "text": "Christopher Luxon discusses cost of living, and what to expect this weekend from the National Party conference.\n\nOPINION: If Christopher Luxon\u2019s week were to be summed up in pictures, they wouldn\u2019t be happy snaps.\n\nIn a series of images \u2013 from Apia to an ice hockey game \u2013 he was the embodiment of misery. One made the front page of the Samoa Observer, where he appeared utterly glum and distracted next to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.\n\nEven the sunniest of us would struggle to compete with Ardern\u2019s luminous smile \u2013 even if it is stretching thinner by the day.\n\nAnd these are just brief snapshots in time, an unfortunate angle captured that likely changed with his expression in the next second.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* The political lines have been drawn for a traditional left-right battle\n\n* National leader Christopher Luxon knows the 'what', needs to work on the 'how'\n\n* Luxon's views speak volumes about his attitude to women\n\nBut still. Luxon\u2019s leadership has hit turbulence and every bump is etched on his face.\n\nBy any measure, the week started well for National. Christopher Bishop revealed new figures that showed the number of those living in cars quadrupled over five years \u2013 a blow right to the heart of Ardern\u2019s crusade to alleviate child poverty.\n\nNicola Willis, and Christopher Luxon take questions from reporters.\n\nIt was a quick one-two from the party\u2019s strongest performers: Nicola Willis sucked any triumph out of the delivery of Labour\u2019s cost of living payment, as the first instalment of the $350 sweetener dropped into bank accounts.\n\nShe slugged away at the flagship Budget 2022 policy, as it transpired the cash was going offshore, to the dead, and only to 1.3 million people, not the 2.1m claimed in a campaign email.\n\nThis was a masterclass in Opposition politics \u2013 poking holes in policy and underscoring over-promises and under-delivery. Heading into the weekend\u2019s annual conference, MPs were rightly jubilant \u2013 when you are on the shadow benches, morale is half the battle.\n\nAnd then Luxon came back from Samoa. On Wednesday morning, he sweated his way through an interview with the AM Show\u2019s Ryan Bridge, growing twitchier by the question.\n\nYou could hear high priest of spin Steven Joyce weeping into his Sultana Bran as Luxon careered off message, and then finally reversed into a hole \u2013 flip-flopping on a pledge to match health funding to inflation.\n\nIt was the latest in a line of flubs \u2013 but this one has real consequences. Labour\u2019s attack line is that National will cut spending on vital services \u2013 now they have it from the horse\u2019s mouth.\n\nWith all the finesse of David Brent, he then blundered into an off-key, on-camera rendition of a hiphop song before unveiling an egg-shaped Humpty Dumpty puppet of himself.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say all the King\u2019s men are now wondering if they can put Humpty back together again.\n\nMPs and elders have begun to reluctantly acknowledge that his inexperience is becoming a real problem. Polling is starting to slip (although that\u2019s coming off what was probably an artificial high) \u2013 as is patience.\n\nConfidence, presentation, message discipline \u2013 these are all things that can be fixed with some relentless focus and good advisors.\n\nBut a leader either has good political instincts and antennae, or they don\u2019t. And people are starting to wonder about Luxon\u2019s. Internally, there is frustration that he is too dismissive of both advice and the power of the Press Gallery.\n\nThis unease is coupled with some niggles in the wider party about what should be an exultant conference in Christchurch. Delegates are scratchy about a lacklustre programme \u2013 with only MPs in the speaking slots. They are openly gossiping about a late-issued agenda (a misprint has Luxon speaking for more than 12 hours, causing one wag to compare him to Fidel Castro) and a scramble to secure someone local to perform the p\u014dwhiri, the sour after-taste of Judith Collins\u2019 race-baiting politics.\n\nThe jokes are edged with tension which suggests Luxon doesn\u2019t yet command the respect of the ranks: is Te Puke pizza (ham, cheese and pineapple) on the menu at the Te Pae convention centre? Will he greet us with \u2018aloha\u2019?\n\nThat they are able to laugh is promise enough. Last year\u2019s AGM was a miserable affair \u2013 with rows over conversion therapy legislation, the dramatic resignation of stalwart Sir David Carter, and scuffles over how much power the board can wield. Compared to where they were a year ago (about 28%), there is much to celebrate.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair that Luxon cops all the blame for the week\u2019s drama. It was Nicola Willis who first said National was \u201cundecided\u201d whether the party's health funding would match inflation, setting the boss up for inevitable questions.\n\nAnd it was Willis who appeared to park the party\u2019s major tax promises (contradicting Luxon) in an interview this week. To be fair to her, there is some dispute over what exactly was said \u2013 but the political week ended with confusion around their most significant policy.\n\nHis problems are not insurmountable. He has plenty of time to mature into the role before the voting public start paying real attention. A year from now few will remember his Hawaii holiday or comments that Kiwi businesses are getting soft.\n\nIn the meantime, the party will just have to grin and bear it.",

      "text": "A week ago, he was one of the few proper superstars of the big screen and now everyone is steering clear of his toxic brand thanks to his violent antics onstage at the Oscars.\n\nFor Hollywood studios, that means either pulling out or pausing upcoming projects involving the actor. No one wants a publicity tour dominated by reruns of the infamous footage or 342 questions from journalists about his rehabilitation.\n\nThe Smith moratorium is expected to be temporary, with an unnamed studio executive telling The Hollywood Reporter that \u201che\u2019s not kryptonite yet\u201d.\n\nThe revelation of a violent, dark side in such a public way has jeopardised the decades Smith has spent carefully curating a reputation as a hard worker, as a box office draw and as an approachable, affable celebrity who turned it on for fans on the red carpet and in interviews.\n\nStream more entertainment news live & on demand with Flash. 25+ news channels in 1 place. New to Flash? Try 1 month free. Offer ends 31 October, 2022 >\n\nUntil Smith can fully rehabilitate his image, which could include a reconciliation with Chris Rock, the comedian he slapped onstage for a joke directed at his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, Smith\u2019s brand is tarnished.\n\nFor the moment though, there\u2019s a risk in releasing a Smith project anytime soon. Among those in jeopardy:\n\nNetflix was already skittish about the thriller Fast & Loose. A week before the Oscars, Fast & Loose lost its director in David Leitch, the stuntman-turned-filmmaker who helmed Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2 and the upcoming Bullet Train.\n\nLeitch was attached to two films, Fast & Loose at Netflix and Fall Guy at Universal. Leitch decided to go with the Ryan Gosling-starring Fall Guy as his next project which left Fast & Loose without a director.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, once Netflix lost Leitch, the streamer scrambled to find a replacement, but not in the time before the Smith debacle consumed the industry and global headlines.\n\nWith the double whammy of no director and a star who did a 180 from asset to liability, Fast & Loose has been \u201cquietly moved\u201d to the back burner, reported THR.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean the movie will never be made, or even made with a different person, but with this much drama surrounding it off-screen, Netflix will want to give it some time before rolling cameras.\n\nThe movie was to feature Smith as an amnesiac that slowly discovers his double life as a rich crime boss and poor CIA agent.\n\nSmith has already wrapped filming on Emancipation, which makes it the most pressing upcoming release on his slate.\n\nThe movie is based on the true story of an escaped enslaved person during the American Civil War, whose horrific scarring was captured in a series of photographs. Director Antoine Fuqua said the script had \u201chit my heart and soul in so many ways\u201d.\n\nSmith plays the lead role alongside Ben Foster, Mustafa Shakir and Australian actor Charmaine Bingwa, from a screenplay by William N. Collage.\n\nApple bought the distribution rights to Emancipation for a reported $US130 million in a bidding war against studios Warner Bros, MGM, Lionsgate and Universal. At the time, it was a coup for the tech company to secure the rights to a Smith star vehicle which also had potential as a serious awards season contender.\n\nApple became the first streaming service to win the Best Picture Oscar at this year\u2019s ceremony with the heartwarming CODA, which the company bought for $US25 million after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nEmancipation was originally expected to be released later this year, presumably at one of the prestigious film festivals that traditionally serve as a launch pad for an Oscars campaign, such as Venice, Telluride, Toronto or New York.\n\nEarly speculation was that Smith was expected to be competitive on the awards circuit for the second consecutive year \u2013 if he had prevailed, he would\u2019ve become that rare actor with back-to-back Oscar wins, a club that only includes Tom Hanks and Spencer Tracy as members.\n\nIf Apple ploughs ahead with its original release plan for the next awards season, it may find itself facing headwinds. One Oscar voter, actor Rutanya Alda, told THR she had voted for Smith this year for his role in King Richard, but would \u201cnever, ever vote for anything Will Smith is in again\u201d after he assaulted Rock.\n\nOne of Smith\u2019s earliest big screen successes was the 1995 Michael Bay caper Bad Boys, in which he starred alongside Martin Lawrence as two Miami cops investigating a cocaine heist.\n\nThe film was a financial success and a bigger-budgeted sequel followed in 2003. It would be another 17 years before Smith, Bay and Lawrence reunited for the next instalment Bad Boys for Life. As one of the few blockbusters to be released in 2020 before the pandemic shutdown of cinemas, it became one of the year\u2019s highest grossing films.\n\nAnother sequel was greenlit almost immediately by Sony.\n\nNow, in the wake of the Smith scandal, Bad Boys 4 could become another casualty. THR cited an inside source who claimed Bad Boys 4 has been moved from active development to \u201cpause\u201d. The same article said Smith already had 40 pages of the script before the Oscars shenanigans.\n\nThrough Westbrook, the production company founded by Smith and Pinkett Smith in 2019, Smith is a producer on several projects, including ones in which neither he nor his wife appears on screen.\n\nThe most high-profile of those are Cobra Kai, the Karate Kid sequel series, and Bel-Air, a dramatic reboot of his 1990s sitcom Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Cobra Kai and Bel-Air are not expected to be affected by Smith\u2019s troubles as both are less obviously associated with him.\n\nKing Richard, the Richard Williams biopic for which he won his Best Actor Oscar, was also produced by Westbrook.\n\nWestbrook was recently valued at $US600 million after selling a minority stake to former Disney executives Tom Staggs and Kevin Mayer.\n\nThere are also several works in the pipeline across a jumble of studios and streamers, including Emancipation, a remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles to star Smith and Kevin Hart, an adaptation of The Alchemist and a sequel to I Am Legend.\n\nNone of those projects are very far along in their development. Hart said in mid-2021 that he and Smith are both still \u201ctrying to figure out\u201d the Planes, Trains and Automobiles remake.\n\nHe told Forbes, \u201cRight now, it\u2019s on the table. The world of development is a long one and we know that the IP is there. Everybody was willing to let us get into it, but we\u2019ve got to crack the code on what the story is.\u201d",

      "text": "Scarlett Johansson will take on a classic monster role with a twist. The actor will play the lead role in Bride, a feature film take on the classic Bride of Frankenstein character.\n\nBride is described as a \u201cgenre-bending take on the well-known character\u2019s story.\u201d It follows a woman modeled as the ideal wife who rejects her male creator and escapes from his obsessive clutches. She then tries to create a new identity for herself in a world that views her as a monster.\n\nSebasti\u00e1n Lelio will direct the Apple and A24 film. Lelio previously won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for A Fantastic Woman. He also co-wrote the script with Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo. (Angelo also wrote Ryan Gosling\u2019s upcoming Wolfman.)\n\n\u201cIt is long overdue for Bride to step out of the shadow of her male counterpart and stand alone,\u201d Johansson told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWorking alongside Rebecca Angelo and Lauren Schuker Blum, Sebasti\u00e1n and I are extremely excited to emancipate this classic anti-heroine and reanimate her story to reflect the change we see today.\u201d\n\nThough related to the classic monster character, Johansson\u2019s Bride film is not related to Universal\u2019s monster movie remakes. Ultimately, Universal also plans to produce a Bride of Frankenstein film. However, those plans are still in the very early stages. The studio will first produce a Wolfman film starring Ryan Gosling. 2017\u2019s The Mummy starring Tom Cruise was also part of this classic monster series.\n\nMeanwhile, Johansson fans continue to wait for the release of Marvel\u2019s Black Widow, which has suffered multiple release delays due to COVID-19.\n\nAre you excited to see Johansson put a spin on the classic Bride of Frankenstein character? Let us know in the comments.",

She admitted that Gosling was her 90s crush when they both auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club.\n\nIronically Jessica Simpson viewed the movie for the first time on a plane, right after announcing her separation from ex-husband Nick Lachey in 2005. \u201cOh God, I thought,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe most romantic movie in the world, and I was leaving Nick \u2026 The movie was on every screen, and I was swept up into it, wishing I had that great love that would be forever.\u201d",

I would not have done that,\u201d she said.\n\nNewsreader Monique Wright said the volunteer may have thought Kochie was \u201ccoming on to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she declared.\n\nSport presenter Mark Beretta added: \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of Kochie to have on top of you,\u201d before suggesting the man may need to \u201cgo to therapy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI must admit, I pictured myself being a bit more agile,\u201d Kochie said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cA big thank you to them all for looking after me, my goodness they are good.\u201d",

      "text": "If there's one thing we know about Hollywood couple Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling it's that... well...there isn't a lot to know about them!\n\nThe actors and parents of two have been notoriously private about their relationship since meeting in 2011 and even hid their pregnancies with daughters, Esmeralda, 6,\u00a0 and Amada, 4.\n\nSo when a troll gave Eva unsolicited advice about her relationship, she took the opportunity to respond - and did so in the classiest way possible.\n\nWant to join the family? Sign up to our Kidspot newsletter to read more stories like this.\n\nRELATED: Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes reveal their one strict parenting rule\n\nThe private couple welcomed their daughters in 2014 and 2016. Source: Getty.\n\nThe actress shared a rare throwback photo of herself to Instagram by the ocean and wrote: \"Went for a run along the beach this morning,\" before joking, \"no I didn't.\"\n\n\"This picture was taken at least 15 years ago. Haven\u2019t seen a beach this year. Haven\u2019t been on a run this year,\" she wrote.\n\nHowever, one follower took it as an opportunity to comment on her relationship with her partner of nine years.\n\n\"You need to tell Ryan to get you out more,\" they wrote.\n\nRELATED: Ashton Kutcher\u2019s emotional speech about his family will melt your heart\n\nMendes was quick to respond, in an interaction captured by Comments by Celebs.\n\n\"No thank you, I'm good,\" the mother of two replied.\u00a0\"Rather be home with my man than anywhere else in the world.\"\n\nAnd can you blame her!?\n\n\"Your hubby is the model of my dad when he was a young man, so I'm always reminded of him when I watch Ryan... you\u2019re the most beautiful woman in the world in my opinion and one of my fave actors... you both decorate the world for me,\" one fan commented.\n\nMendes liked the fan's comment and replied, \"What a beautiful comment. Thank you for this. Hope you and yours are well. All my love.\"\n\nEva first met Ryan in 2011 on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines and began dating soon afterwards.",

      "text": "If there's one thing the internet really can't quite handle it's a middle-aged man experiencing something of a style renaissance.\n\nRemember the reactions to former US president Barack Obama's\u00a0deeply unbuttoned shirt\u00a0and\u00a0leather jacket?\u00a0(Let's not discuss the backwards cap, wetsuit or that photo of him\u00a0taking a holiday snap of Michelle with his iPad in total dad style.)\n\nAs Max Berlinger\u00a0wrote in a sharp critique of Obama's post-presidential style in\u00a0GQ, \"It wasn't even until Obama left the White House for good that we learned his\u00a0dorky\u00a0dad style was nothing more than an elaborate act to suppress his inner\u00a0style god\u00a0(though we\u00a0had our suspicions).\"\n\nNow the internet is getting very hot and bothered about Steve Carell, aged 54.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Steve Carell hopes you want to throw up after seeing The Big Short\n\n*\u00a0The incredible Steve Carell\n\n*\u00a0Steve Carell forms a God complex\n\nYes, Steve Carell from\u00a0The Office. Steve Carell who plays nice, bumbling dad characters. And yes, Steve Carell who was in that Ryan Gosling movie where he had a makeover (a movie trope usually left to women removing their glasses and suddenly becoming a babe) and turned from frumpy dadbod to suave man about town in custom Zegna suits. So, really,\u00a0we always knew he had it in him.\n\nSteve Carrell has played a man who gets a midlife crisis make over.\n\nAnyway, Carell is on the press circuit to promote his new movie,\u00a0Despicable Me 3\u00a0(yes a kid's movie, yes these feelings about Steve Carell's hotness feel a bit weird in this context). And new shots of him man-about-towning in London have posed this question: When did Steve Carell turn into such a silver fox?\n\nIn said photos he wore a navy jumper layered over a chambray shirt that fit just so with perfectly pressed chinos and brown leather sneakers. His tortoiseshell sunglasses, an item\u00a0scientifically proven to make people significantly better looking, were not the kind of transition lenses often found on gentleman of his vintage. They were cool.\n\nHis silver hair was tousled just so.\n\nSteve Carell back in 2014 when he was still just a guy who wore brown suits and loved lamp.\n\nHonestly take your Goslings and your Zayns Malik and give me 2017 Steve Carell pic.twitter.com/lUWWF2A8Ue\u2014 Chloe Gilke (@GilkeAsCharged)   June 21, 2017        Steve Carrell is hot and you can't convince me otherwise pic.twitter.com/0AJ8Ulv5aF\u2014 Sam Stryker (@sbstryker)   June 22, 2017        2017 Steve Carrell would be good to me, this I know to be true. pic.twitter.com/aTikkMAnEh\u2014 wrecker of my joy (@buttmacklinfbi)   June 23, 2017\n\nSo what is it about a middle-aged man's style makeover that so captures our interest?\n\nBeyond the inherent likeability of both Carell and Obama, perhaps it's the idea that, well, there by the grace of God go I? If they can look that good in the years that they're meant to be settling into a little doughiness and deliberately daggy clothes, well isn't that a little hope for us all?\n\nAnd the thing is, it's not that hard to look sharp. It comes down to tailoring:\u00a0wear clothes that fit and, if they don't, get them tailored. To paraphrase\u00a0Ryan Gosling in that male makeover movie,\u00a0Crazy, Stupid, Love,\u00a0you're better than the Gap. Which is to say, it's not about\u00a0not\u00a0shopping at the Gap, but it is about wearing clothes that make you feel good. Not buying a bunch of unflattering clothes and making do.\u00a0To borrow from a marketing mantra:\u00a0you're worth it.\n\nAs Dayna Pink, the costume designer behind Carell's makeover in the movie,\u00a0told\u00a0GQ,\n\n\"I love putting Steve in great suits. I love it. When we put him in a great suit, and I see that smile on his face, it's great. He looks great in clothes. Really, the challenge was making him\u00a0schlubby\u00a0in the beginning. Putting a great suit on him is so easy, but it was harder to put that big, oversized, horizontal-stripe polo\u2014you put that on and go, 'Oh god.'\u00a0We looked in the mirror and we're like, 'Oh, that's it. That's it.'\"\n\nAnd that, that feeling good and wearing clothes that suit you, is the secret to Steve Carell's style makeover. Hotness is merely about how you're feeling. And a pair of well-pressed trousers.",

      "text": "Compared to Wall St, 2015's The Big Short offered a very different look at America's financial institutions.\n\nUnless you're very young, profoundly self-absorbed, or just slumped in the corner of a bar, you're probably more-or-less aware that the world in general, and the American banking system in particular, ran into a patch of poo back in 2007/8, the effects of which are still being felt.\n\nWe call it the GFC (for Global Financial Crisis), because nothing can be allowed to exist today without a catchy acronym.\n\nThe GFC came about because a group of American banks began to play daft and loose. An investment product they were selling was comprised mostly of bundles of the high-risk loans and mortgages which had been granted to anyone with a piggy bank and a convincing alibi back in the heady days of the housing bubble.\n\nSteve Carell and Ryan Gosling are part of a star-studded cast of Hollywood A-list actors on display in The Big Short.\n\nThese bundles of debt were labeled \"CDOs\" (Collateralised Debt Obligations), given a stamp of approval by the lackeys of the \"ratings agencies\" and flicked off to any pension fund that felt like having a flutter. The banker's reasoning was that as long as the housing market didn't collapse, then the chickens would never come home to roost. Well, good luck with that.\n\nA very few plucky investors did see what was coming down the river and tried to warn the banks. And when the banks laughed them out of the office, they concocted a scheme to make out like bandits at the expense of everybody else.\u00a0The Big Short\u00a0is the \u2013 mostly, kinda \u2013\u00a0true story of how that happened.\n\nChristian Bale, Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell \u2013 in one the best line-ups of talent you're going to see all year \u2013 are the unlikely perpetrators. Bale plays Michael Burry, a doctor turned hedge-fund guru who saw the crisis before anyone else and eventually delivered a 490 per cent profit to his investors by betting against the American banking system.\n\nCarell and Pitt act out variations of the same story, weaving together other true tales of people who realised early that the housing bubble would collapse and take a large chunk of America's supposed wealth with it. Gosling does a good turn as a fictional investment analyst and part-time narrator, \u00a0talking us through the action.\n\nAll of which makes\u00a0The Big Short, even fronted by that galaxy of A grade male stars, sound like it could be a dull and bookish time. But no. Director Adam McKay (Anchorman) throws a whole box of po-mo doco innovation at the screen: breaking the fourth wall at will, freeze frames, celeb' cameos (\"here's Anthony Bourdain to explain that...\") McKay claims\u00a0American Splendor\u00a0as an inspiration, which endeared him and his film to me immediately.\n\nThe result is something that manages to be funny, fluid, watchable, dispiritingly blokish (it used to be every cop movie had a scene set in a strip club. Now it seems to be an essential part of every banking movie), well-acted and quite engrossing.\n\nYou'll need to watch Charles Ferguson's doco\u00a0Inside Job\u00a0to get the full story. But as an idiot's guide to the GFC and a pretty entertaining film in it's own right,\u00a0The Big Short\u00a0comes recommended.",

It was just the way things were.\n\n\u201cI was terrified for our future, I was terrified for Chez, I was terrified because I felt so helpless. It was really hard.\u201d\n\nAs the conversation continued, Chezzi said she was \u201cgetting quite teary now\u201d as she spoke of carrying \u201ca lot of guilt for some time\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou question, \u2018Could I have done something better? Did it affect the bond between me and my child?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd as a mum, you always have mum guilt.\u201d\n\nAlong with Sailor, 11, the couple has two younger daughters, Scout, seven, and Sunday, one.\n\nFor more engaging celebrity content, visit 7Life on Facebook.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nSummer is well underway, and this season's best beach reads are heating up best-seller lists. However, not everyone prefers black-and-white print format, especially now, when so many talented voice-over actors have entered the book-narration landscape. Hence the beauty of audiobooks.\n\nNot sure what to listen to while sunbathing on the beach, driving long hours on a road trip to your summer vacation, taking a solo hike in the mountains, puttering in your own back garden, lounging in a backyard hammock or\u00a0working the grill? CBS Essentials has sourced out some of the hottest audiobooks of the moment in every type of genre -- political thriller , sci-fi, romance and memoir included.\n\nAn added bonus? All are available on Amazon, and also Audible, so you can use your credits to listen.\n\nZakiya Dalila Harris' debut novel is one of this summer's hottest thrillers, generating tons of buzz. An \"immersive, genre-bending debut,\" per The New York Times, and an Amazon editors' pick as a best book of June 2021, \"The Other Black Girl\" is inspired by the author's own experience in publishing. At 26, Nella is the only Black woman at a top publishing house -- until glamorous Hazel-May McCall waltzes in. The two become fast friends, until she realizes her new confidante is not who she seems, threatening more than Nella's career.\n\nDanny Trejo's life story is just as compelling and unbelievable as some of the characters he has played in his blockbuster film career. \"Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood,\" chronicles the actor's extraordinary life, which involves stints in San Quentin, a brutal battle with addiction, a harrowing and inspiring journey to recovery and an accidental rise to fame. The read is action-packed and inspiring. What makes the audiobook even more entertaining: the spirited narration of Trejo himself, along with fellow actor (and co-author) Donal Logue.\n\nJennifer Weiner is one of the reigning queens of beach reads. Her 2021 release, \"That Summer,\" doesn't disappoint. Suburban housewife Daisy Shoemaker starts getting mysterious emails directed at a woman named Diana Starling. Starling's life as a single woman -- glamorous and powerful, running a huge corporation -- is drastically different from Shoemaker's. \u00a0The two develop a friendship, but their supposedly accidental connection isn't quite what it seems, and Shoemaker must learn who Starling really is and what she wants. Sutton Foster of \"Younger\" fame narrates.\n\nElin Hilderbrand, another reigning beach-read queen, brings us back to the coastal town of Nantucket, this time to chronicle the life and death of author Vivian Howe. After she is hit by a car, Howe ascends to Beyond, where she is granted a last gift: She can watch her family from above for one final summer. She is also given three chances to change the outcome of what happens down on earth. Considering that her three children are all immersed in their own life dramas, and her final, unfinished manuscript reveals a childhood secret that could alter her reputation, Howe must use these chances carefully.\n\nIn Laura Dave's latest mystery, \"The Last Thing He Told Me,\" Hannah Hall's husband goes missing. The man leaves only a note, asking Hall to take care of his teenage daughter, Bailey, who wants little to do with her stepmother. As the two scramble to find out what happened to the man they love, they are confronted with the shocking and heartbreaking reality that he isn't who he seems. Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine production company snapped up the rights to the book several months prior to publication;\u00a0Apple TV+\u00a0will air it, and\u00a0Julia Roberts\u00a0has signed on to play the lead.\n\nAndy Weir (\"The Martian) penned this sci-fi beach read. Ryland Grace is a middle school teacher-turned-astronaut who wakes up in a spaceship with no recollection of who he is or why he is floating in outer space. Flashbacks leading up to the launch of the Hail Mary spacecraft help him remember why he is 12 light years from Earth -- and some details of his greater mission. \"Project Hail Mary\" will, natch, soon come to the big screen, with Ryan Gosling signed on to play the lead.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and best-selling author James Patterson team up for their second White House-centric political thriller, a \"highly entertaining book\" per The New York Times. President Matthew Keating's teenage daughter is kidnapped by terrorists. After the U. S. government refuses to help recover her, Keating, an ex-Navy SEAL, goes rogue, assembling his own team of SEALs and Secret Service agents. With plenty of details chronicling the inner workings of government, courtesy of Clinton, and Patterson's page-turning prose, the story has already established itself as a New York Times best seller.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald fans might like this reinvisioned version of \"The Great Gatsby.\" In the American literature masterpiece, Jordan Baker is a white southerner with a somewhat minor role as a love interest of narrator Nick Carroway. In \"The Chosen and the Beautiful,\" she is the narrator. She is also a queer Vietnamese adoptee, and while she is just as priviliged, educated and sophisticated as her peers of the swinging 1920s, she faces racial discrimination and homophobia. This coming-of-age tale is \"jazzier\" than the original, per The Washington Post, and has a whimsical twist -- Jordan can also perform magic.\n\nTaylor Jenkins Reed started her career in film production, so it's no surprise that her books read like movies. In \"Malibu Rising,\" her latest novel, the author brings us back to 1983 and the glamorous beaches of Malibu, California, where the rock-royalty Riva family is throwing an annual summer bash. But this year's party turns out to be more of a rager than ever; a wildfire sparks a serious twist. The fate of the four Riva children isn't revealed until the end of this audiobook, narrated by fellow author and actress Julia Whelan.\n\n\"The Guncle\" gets its name from protagonist Patrick, a struggling actor and gay uncle to a beloved neice and nephew. When tragedy strikes, his role as the fun GUP (gay uncle Patrick) gets majorly upgraded to full-time caretaker. \"Rowley's depth and humor will warm even the most jaded hearts,\" The Washington Post said of the \"feel-good\" novel. The audiobook is narrated by the author, Steven Rowley.",

      "text": "El estricto estilo de vida de Ryan Gosling para tener el cuerpo de un h\u00e9roe de acci\u00f3n\n\nEl actor sigue una dieta muy estricta y no consiente hacer ning\u00fan exceso\n\nRecomendaciones para ir de acampada con ni\u00f1os y no morir en el intento\n\nRyan Gosling protagoniza una de las secuelas m\u00e1s esperadas de la historia del cine.\n\nPese a que Netflix vive un mal momento, con p\u00e9rdida de suscriptores y decisiones pol\u00e9micas, ha tenido dos alegr\u00edas recientes: la cuarta temporada de Strangher Things y el exitoso estreno de El agente invisible. En esta pel\u00edcula, la plataforma ha conseguido reunir a Chris Evans, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, Ana de Armas y Ryan Gosling, que es el protagonista indiscutible de la cinta.\n\nGosling, que en estos momentos est\u00e1 rodando Barbie, se pone en la piel de un agente implacable de la CIA que no deja t\u00edtere sin cabeza. El problema es que pasa de ser el asesino a ser el objetivo de la propia agencia. Para poder meterse en la piel del agente Sierra Seis, Gosling, que siempre ha sido bastante delgado, ha tenido que conseguir el cuerpo de un h\u00e9roe de acci\u00f3n y poder igualar las fuerzas con el siempre musculado Evans.\n\nPara protagonizar una pel\u00edcula con escenas trepidantes y peleas cuerpo a cuerpo con complejas coreograf\u00edas hay que prepararse a conciencia. Para conseguirlo, Gosling ha explicado a JOE que ha pasado siete meses practicando artes marciales para que las escenas de lucha quedaran realistas.\n\n\"Hab\u00eda un equipo de especialistas incre\u00edble que me mostraba todos estos estilos diferentes de artes marciales, y luego trataba de averiguar lo que funcionar\u00eda mejor para m\u00ed y tambi\u00e9n para el personaje, as\u00ed que ellos crearon este estilo para m\u00ed\u201d, ha explicado el actor en la entrevista.\n\nPor otra parte, Gosling ha tenido que seguir un entrenamiento de fuerza, del que no ha dado demasiado detalles, para poder ser Sierra Seis: \"Levant\u00e9 pesos bastante pesados. Hice m\u00e1s ejercicio del que normalmente har\u00eda. Y com\u00ed menos de lo normal\u201d.\n\nGosling ha ganado unos cuantos kilos de m\u00fasculo\n\nPero la cosa no queda ah\u00ed ya que Simu Liu, otro actor muy musculado y compa\u00f1ero de Gosling en Barbie, ha asegurado en una entrevista con ET que el actor que m\u00e1s tiempo dedica a cultivar el cuerpo de todo el elenco es Ryan Gosling. Es m\u00e1s, ha garantizado que el int\u00e9rprete incorpora a su rutina varias dobles sesiones diarias a la semana. \u201cDefinitivamente es un tipo que va al gimnasio por la ma\u00f1ana y al gimnasio despu\u00e9s del trabajo\u201d, ha comentado el int\u00e9rprete chino, conocido por ser Shang-Chi en el Universo Cinematogr\u00e1fico de Marvel.\n\nA estas alturas ya se sabe que la dieta juega un papel important\u00edsimo a la hora de perder peso o crear m\u00fasculo. Somos los que comemos y Gosling lo sabe. Por este motivo tiene una gran fuerza de voluntad para poder cortar de ra\u00edz todos los alimentos que no le convienen para subir de peso limpiamente. De hecho, Liu tambi\u00e9n ha destacado que Ryan Gosling no comete ning\u00fan exceso y \u00e9l s\u00ed: \u201cLo respeto pero voy a tomar un poco de refresco\u201d.\n\nLa dieta del actor est\u00e1 basada, esencialmente, en pescado fresco, arroz y todo tipo de verduras. Pocas calor\u00edas y una gran cantidad de prote\u00ednas procedentes del pescado. A partir de aqu\u00ed, no consiente hacer ning\u00fan exceso pese a ser una persona muy golosa. Y es que tiene una gran obsesi\u00f3n: los Twizzlers, una especie de regaliz muy popular en Norteam\u00e9rica.\n\nRyan Gosling interpretando a Ken, el musculoso novio de Barbie\n\nEmma Stone, actriz que protagoniz\u00f3 La La Land junto a Gosling, coment\u00f3 en una entrevista con Vanity Fair que su partener puede \u201ccomer m\u00e1s Twizzlers que nadie que hayas conocido\u201d. Seg\u00fan ella, Gosling se guardaba esta gominola en los bolsillos e iba por el set de rodaje comi\u00e9ndolos y reparti\u00e9ndolos. As\u00ed que ha tenido que luchar contra sus propias ansias de comer dulce.\n\nLos hermanos Russo, directores de El agente invisible, tambi\u00e9n han hablado sobre los h\u00e1bitos alimenticios de Gosling. Y han destacado su gran disciplina para no salirse de la dieta. En este sentido, Anthony Russo ha explicado a EW que se sent\u00edan \u201cmuy culpables porque Ryan llevaba una dieta muy estricta durante mucho tiempo\u201d mientras que ellos solamente se daban caprichos. El actor solamente pec\u00f3 una vez y porque el rodaje estaba a punto de acabar: \u201cEst\u00e1bamos a una semana del final del rodaje, y Joe y yo est\u00e1bamos comiendo una gran pizza en el plat\u00f3. Ryan dijo: \"\u00bfSabes qu\u00e9? Hoy voy a comer un poco de esa maldita pizza'. Y lo hizo, y estaba muy contento\".\n\nEsta es la dieta que sigue Bella Hadid antes de enfrentarse a un importante trabajo\n\nLa nueva e intensa rutina de la app de Chris Hemsworth para el tronco superior\n\nLa dieta de Blake Lively que acaba con la tripa hinchada\n\nSainz no llega a meta e intentar\u00e1 seguir este viernes: \"He visto volar a Peterhansel\"\n\nOtro sustituto fallido de Doncic: Dallas corta a Kemba Walker\n\nElche - Celta, en directo | Sigue en vivo el partido de LaLiga Santander\n\nLa emotiva despedida de la Sampdoria a Luca Vialli: uno di noi\n\nSainz, Peterhansel y Al-Rajhi se detuvieron en el mismo punto pr\u00e1cticamente al mismo tiempo\n\nUn brutal tiroteo en Miami deja 10 heridos\n\nPedri analiza el duelo ante el Atl\u00e9tico para Dazn",

The voice cast includes horror legends like Ted Raimi, David Arquette, Lance Henriksen, and Lin Shaye. It also includes stars like Ariel Winter, Justice Smith, and Brenda Song.\n\nAs with any good horror movie or game, the story is important. In The Quarry, players follow the teenage counselors of Hackett\u2019s Quarry, who make the decision to throw a party for the last day of summer camp. If you couldn\u2019t guess, things go poorly, and they\u2019re hunted by crazed locals and something far more frightening in the woods.\n\nPlayers take control of each of the nine camp counselors and their choices to shape the story. Like a choose-your-adventure book, each decision changes the outcome for the character. Up to seven players can join in with online play. People can watch along and vote on storyline decisions or they can play together in a couch co-op experience.\n\nDirector Will Byles had this to say about the game.\n\nThe Quarry\u00a0is breaking new ground across interactive storytelling and technology to create a truly visceral teen-horror experience. I can\u2019t wait to see the choices you make, who you\u2019ll save, and who you\u2019re willing to sacrifice!\n\nThe Quarry releases June 10th on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.\n\nFor more on gaming or horror, check back to That Hashtag Show.",

I\u2019m sorry. Thank you though. Bye!\u201d\n\nAguilera frowns and replies, \u201cI can\u2019t, but I\u2019m happy for her,\u201d before being escorted away from the press line.\n\nSpears took to Instagram to express her dissatisfaction with the \u201cAin\u2019t No Other Man\u201d singer\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cI LOVE AND ADORE EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTED ME\u2026BUT REFUSING TO SPEAK WHEN YOU KNOW THE TRUTH, IS EQUIVALENT TO A LIE !!!!,\u201d she captioned the Aguilera interview clip in her Instagram Story.\n\n\u201c13 YEARS BEING IN A CORRUPT ABUSIVE SYSTEM YET WHY IS IT SUCH A HARD TOPIC FOR PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT ???\n\n\u201cI\u2019M THE ONE WHO WENT THROUGH IT !!!! ALL THE SUPPORTERS WHO SPOKE UP AND SUPPORTED ME THANK YOU\u2026YES I DO MATTER !!!!!\u201d\n\nSpears then recognised Lady Gaga for her support by sharing a clip of the \u201cRain On Me\u201d singer also being asked about Spears on a recent red carpet for her new film \u201cHouse of Gucci.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way that she was treated in this business was really wrong and the way that women are treated in the music industry is something that I wish we change,\u201d Gaga said.\n\n\u201cI think that she will forever be an inspiration to women.\u201d\n\n\u201cTHANK YOU @LADYGAGA FOR GENUINELY TAKING YOUR TIME TO SAY SOMETHING SO KIND. YOU MADE ME CRY !!! I LOVE YOU !!!\u201d Spears captioned the video clip in her Instagram story.\n\nGaga responded to Spears by sharing some thoughts on her own Instagram story later in the night.\n\n\u201cI prayed for the legal system to treat you like a person.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve now changed the course for women in this industry forever.\n\n\u201cYou stood up for yourself and were so brave. Thank you.\u201d\n\nAguilera and Spears skyrocketed to fame after being child stars on Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Mickey Mouse Club\u201d which they co-starred alongside Keri Russell, Justin Timberlake and Ryan Gosling from 1993 to 1994.\n\nBoth singers quickly achieved massive success beginning in 1999 with their debut albums topping the charts, Spears\u2019 \u201c\u2026Baby One More Time\u201d and Aguilera\u2019s self-titled release.\n\nIn 2003, the pair famously shared an on-screen kiss with Madonna at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nFollowing Spears\u2019 scorching testimony this past June about the abuse she says she endured during her conservatorship, Aguilera did voice her support by posting a childhood photo of the pair together on social media.\n\nShe posted a statement that read, in part, \u201cTo a woman who has worked under conditions and pressure unimaginable to most, I promise you she deserves all of the freedom possible to live her happiest life.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to Britney. She deserves all the TRUE love and support in the world.\u201d\n\nSome took to social media to blast Spears for dragging Aguilera, someone who has supported her amid her conservatorship battle.\n\n\u201cI love you @britneyspears but wtf are you thinking?\u201d one person tweeted.\n\n\u201cThis is so petty. @xtina did speak up and publicly support you, and it was actually during the trial.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t stay quiet until you were free and then jump on the #freebritney bandwagon when it was time to promote a movie.\u201d\n\nAnother person wrote, \u201cBritney Spears has every right to be frustrated.\n\n\u201cPeople only speak up on her situation when it benefits them cause wtf did that man mean, \u2018no we\u2019re not doing this right now\u2019?\n\n\u201cChristina Aguilera knows how this industry works.\u201d",

They're laying low. Maybe she wants a family.\"\n\nThe couple were reportedly living secretly in Ibiza for several weeks leading into January, spending their mornings reading the papers over \"smoothies at a vegan cafe\".\n\nNow, she is back in Los Angeles with Robinton \u2014 who reportedly makes big bucks selling legal cannabis in LA.\n\nWatson was thrown into the limelight as a 10-year-old, starring as Hermione Granger in the first Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nShe starred alongside Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), with the three young stars going on to feature in all of the subsequent Harry Potter films.\n\nAfter her stint as a genius witch was up, Watson went on to star in films such as The Bling Ring, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Disney's live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast and most recently Little Women in 2019, which was her last movie project.\n\nAccording to her IMDb page she is not locked in for any future roles.\n\nWatson missed out big time when she and actor Miles Teller were the original cast of La La Land, but they were replaced by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.\n\n\"There was a moment where Emma Watson and Miles Teller were doing it,\" director of the Oscar-nominated film Damien Chazelle revealed recently.\n\n\"Neither of those casting things wound up lasting or working out.\"\n\n\"It's one of these frustrating things where names get attached to projects very early on as a way to build anticipation for something that's coming before anything is really actually agreed,\" she said.",

      "text": "Cody Simpson\u2019s romance with Miley Cyrus looked to be burning bright hot for those that followed it on social media, but the aspiring Olympian has been less than glowing about their relationship.\n\nIn a new interview he has described it as \u201cjust one of those phases\u201d.\n\nThe 24-year-old singer and swimmer ended his relationship with the Malibu hitmaker in August last year after less than a year together, and has now insisted \u201ceverything ended fairly amicably\u201d between them.\n\nHowever, Simpson seemed to suggest the romance didn\u2019t have a big impact on him, as he labelled their high-profile relationship as a \u201cphase\u201d.\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Australia\u2019s 60 Minutes, he said: \u201cI\u2019d known her for a long time at that point. We went from being good friends, to just having a lot of the same friends, to being together for a while.\n\n\u201cEverything ended fairly amicably, and it was just one of those phases I guess. You go through (it) and you learn a lot from it.\u201d\n\nCyrus, 28, and Simpson started dating in October 2019, shortly after the Midnight Sky hitmaker split from reality star Kaitlynn Carter.\n\nAnd after their split in August, Cyrus said she \u201cjust realised it was time to move on and do their own things\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor right now, two halves can't make a whole, and we're individually just working on ourselves, becoming the people that we want to be,\u201d she said.\n\nALLI SIMPSON DELIGHTED BROTHER CODY SIMPSON IS HAPPY AFTER SPLIT WITH MILEY CYRUS\n\n\u201cLike everybody else at this age, we're just deciding who we want to be with our lives, what we want to do with our lives. And so, don't make it some drama story if next week we hang out and we're getting pizza.\n\n\u201cWe've been friends for 10 years, and we're going to continue to be friends. Just don't make it something that it is not.\u201d\n\nThe Slide Away singer \u2014 who was previously married to actor Liam Hemsworth \u2014 also revealed she doesn't plan on tying the knot again or having children.\n\nAsked if she would wed again or if she hopes to start a family, she said: \u201cNot really, I never really cared that much. I am sure that my fans are going to pull me up at 12 saying 'Oh I want to have kids' but like I don't, as a 27-year-old woman that would have a little bit more of a realistic idea of what they want. That has never been kind of my priority.\u201d",

      "text": "But the actress let her fans have a brief look behind the curtain when she posted a rare video of Gosling, 38, on social media, Fox News reports.\n\nIn a new video, the 45-year-old businesswoman shared a clip from the set of the 2012 movie A Place Beyond the Pines, which they both starred in.\n\n\u201cFlashing back to one of my favourite scenes from A Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d wrote Mendes.\n\nThe two reportedly married in 2016 in a very private ceremony and are parents to their two daughters: Esmerelda, 4, and Amada, 3.\n\nIn May, Mendes opened up to Women\u2019s Health about meeting and falling in love with Gosling and then wanting to have kids.\n\n\u201cRyan Gosling happened. I mean, falling in love with him. Then it made sense for me to have \u2026 not kids, but his kids. It was very specific to him,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2017, the La La Land star dedicated his Golden Globe award win to Mendes in a moving speech.\n\n\u201cWhile I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second, and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer,\u201d Gosling said.\n\n\u201cIf she hadn\u2019t have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank you,\u201d he continued.\n\nAussie Hollywood actor Ben Mendelsohn appeared alongside Gosling and Mendes in The Place Beyond the Pines, a 2012 American crime drama which was well received by critics. The all-star cast also included Bradley Cooper, Ray Liotta, Mahershala Ali and another Aussie, Rose Byrne.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Fox News and is reprinted here with permission.",

      "text": "Far Cry 3: Classic Edition is currently on sale on the PlayStation Store for only $3. If you want to play one of the greatest open world FPS games ever made, now\u2019s your chance.\n\nFor a limited time only, starting today on July 8th, Far Cry 3: Classic Edition is on sale for $3 on the PlayStation Store. To give you an idea of just how insane this price is: the normal price is $29.99. So is this a good deal? Heck yeah. A 90% price cut is always a good deal. At that price, it\u2019s practically free.\n\nThe only catch is that this $3 price will be available only until July 22. Specifically until 11:59 P. M. That\u2019s 2 weeks from today, so you have plenty of time to decide if you want to add Far Cry 3: Classic Edition to your library. Also, please note that this sale is only on the PlayStation Store, so if you don\u2019t have a PS4, well, tough luck.\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference between Far Cry 3: Classic Edition and the normal version? Well, not much really. The Classic Edition is just the regular Far Cry 3 ported to the PS4 and Xbox One. It\u2019s not even a remastered version. In fact, you can only make out slight improvements in graphics when you compare the 2 games side by side. Don\u2019t me me wrong. The improvements in graphics are noticeable, but it\u2019s just that they\u2019re still minor improvements.\n\nThe real improvements are in frame rate and overall performance. Far Cry 3: Classic Edition runs much more smoothly than the original. It\u2019s especially noticeable when you compare the 2 side by side. You can clearly make out the parts where the characters move slightly more slowly compared to how they move in the Classic Edition.\n\nSo is it worth getting by itself? Only if you\u2019ve never played it, or like me, you\u2019ve never finished it. But hey, at least it\u2019s only $3, so you haven\u2019t lost much if you\u2019re not satisfied with it.\n\nThe PS4 version of Far Cry 3: Classic Edition is on sale in the PlayStation Store for $3 until the very end of July 22. You have 2 weeks to decide if you want it, so make them count.",

      "text": "Dancing with the stars judge Julz Tocker has gone back to his primary school in Karori Wellington, to visit the kids and relive memories.\n\nA young Julian Tocker\u00a0remembers the fear as his college bus entered the blacked-out Hataitai tunnel\u00a0that connects Wellington to its southern suburbs.\n\nThe boys on the bus would yell, \"Lights out, driver!\" The entire\u00a0bus would turn\u00a0black. And then the fists\u00a0of Tocker's\u00a0high school peers would hit his body.\n\n\"I'll never forget the school bus. It was diabolical...They'd come and just beat me up,\" the Dancing With The Stars judge recalls, while sitting in a busy Karori cafe.\n\nTocker says his biggest achievement so far has been returning to New Zealand to be a judge on Three's Dancing With The Stars.\n\nThe harsh winter sun streams through the window\u00a0behind him as his aviator sunglasses sit in the middle of the table. He's just finished brunch in his old stomping town, and soon he'll be taking a trip down memory lane\u00a0at his old primary school\u00a0St Teresa's.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Karori dancer hits the big time\n\n*\u00a0Dancing With the Stars: Producers answer five burning questions\n\n*\u00a0Dancing With the Stars NZ: Julz Tocker and Rachel White complete judging panel line-up\n\n*\u00a0DWTS: Judge Julz Tocker and Shavaughn Ruakere knew each other in LA\n\n\"I feel quite passionate about\u00a0coming back to talk to the kids about not letting people bully [them]\u00a0and to not let it affect them and to always stay true to what you want to do,\" he says.\n\n\"If you have a passion for acting or singing, if it's drama or dance or playing an instrument -\u00a0whatever it is -\u00a0I\u00a0really want to try to push that and as long as you keep following that passion, you know it could be for a hobby or a career, it doesn't matter. If you love it, do it.\"\n\nBecause, despite the adversity\u00a0Tocker encountered, that's exactly what he did.\n\nLife hasn't always been a ballroom dance for the 30-year-old judge.\n\nTocker returned to his old primary school to encourage kids to follow their passions.\n\nSimilar to the British film Billy Elliot, where the young ballet dancer hides his love of dance from his boxing fanatic father,\u00a0Tocker\u00a0too grew up in a sport-dominated family - in this case,\u00a0rugby. His father was a rugby player-turned\u00a0coach, his sister married\u00a0former\u00a0New Zealand M\u0101ori and\u00a0Lions player\u00a0Riki Flutey, and\u00a0his brother, JP Tocker, is a former player and rugby commentator.\n\nDancing, Tocker says, was never really an option.\n\nBut the young athlete, who had a foot in\u00a0rugby, cricket, waterpolo, basketball,\u00a0athletics and\u00a0tennis, (as well as drama and speech) saw\u00a0a couple dancing on television. He wanted to give it a shot.\n\nJulz Tocker, 30, returns back to his old school at St Teresa's Primary in in north Wellington.\n\nHe asked his mum to take him to dancing lessons behind his father's back.\n\nWhen Tocker's mum stood\u00a0at the edges of the dance studio watching her son, he asked\u00a0her to leave.\n\n\"I\u00a0was like, you don't come to rugby practice, you don't come to basketball practice, you've never been to cricket practice, trust me I'd know, and you've never been to athletics so why would you come to this,\" he said.\n\n\"I had to control that from the word go and that was also quite interesting. She was supportive of me getting there and I was like, 'OK\u00a0I'll let you know when you can come and get me'.\n\n\"I'd just get myself on the bus after school and get myself into town and go to my Friday night dance class. It was so cool.\"\n\nEventually he told his dad, but his response wasn't so positive.\n\nIt wasn't the children lining up to capture a selfie with the Dancing With The Stars judge, rather it was the parents.\n\n\"Dancing is not seen and that's why I want to come back and I\u00a0want to talk to the kids. I just didn't take no for an answer and I\u00a0didn't take the bullying. Of course I got bullied from everybody,\" he said.\n\nAs Tocker arrives at St Teresa's\u00a0a few kids stare and take snaps with their mobile\u00a0phones,\u00a0but it's the mums that are the first to get selfies with the dancing star.\n\nHis teachers remember him as the flamboyant kid that loved school discos and just\u00a0\"made things happen\".\n\nJulz Tocker hid his love of dancing from his father growing up.\n\nAs a student he'd sellotape plastic bags on the windows of the same school hall where's he's teaching today's school kids\u00a0salsa, to make a Matrix-like production. \"He was just so fun,\" the school secretary Brenda McCabe recalls of him.\n\n\"You always got things organised.\"\n\nTocker took to dancing at 12-years old.\u00a0He was about to transition to\u00a0St\u00a0Patrick's College in Kilbirnie where, while considering leaving school to focus on dance,\u00a0he would encounter even more doubters.\n\nThe 30-year-old dancer was subjected to bullies and ney-sayers growing up.\n\n\"In my college they said, I\u00a0don't know if this is a good idea. Are you sure you know what you are doing?\u00a0I\u00a0think you should stay,\" he says.\n\n\"And I'm like, I'm out. You don't even know what I\u00a0do. You've never seen me dance, you've never seen me perform, you don't even know, so don't give me information on something you don't even know anything about.\n\n\"I look back at that and I remember I was sitting there in the big school assembly at college with 1000 boys and I\u00a0was like, I know I'm going to do something else.\"\n\nHe left school at 16 and went to Australia. From there he went to London, Italy, back to London, lived between Asia and London,\u00a0and then moved to America.\n\nSince then he's played the\u00a0lead role in the 2017 Dirty Dancing USA Broadway tour, was a New Zealand Latin Champion, Australian Latin and Ballroom Champion and was placed in the World Latin American Semi Finalist titles in 2012.\n\nHe's been involved in Dancing With The Stars\u00a0Australia and in the States as a professional dancer, choreographer, and co-hostof the 2015 and 2016 series,\u00a0Dancing With The Stars After Show.\n\nHe also worked\u00a0with Hollywood actors\u00a0Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in the musical film La La Land.\n\n\"It was one of those surreal moments where you go, am I seriously just sitting here on the\u00a0ground eating Tender Greens (a\u00a0US food chain) with Ryan? And\u00a0he just gave me his salad because\u00a0I\u00a0was really hungry still.\n\n\"It was a real special moment. Ryan had obviously lived in NZ while filming and he picked up on my Kiwi accent quite quickly. He was like, 'where are you from bro?' And I was like, 'how can you even do that accent, how do you know?'\n\nAs he makes his way through the hallways\u00a0of his old primary school, reminiscing over memories of having a pizza delivery guy bring free pizza to school because of a speech he was making, he's scribbling his signature of ripped up pieces of paper, dancing and posing for selfies with students and teachers, and marvelling at the fact students have laptops nowadays.\n\nBut, despite the massive achievements he's had overseas and the glamour of working with the world's best, it's coming home to little old New Zealand that the star marks as his career highlight.\n\n\"To be honest with you, it's so full circle because, coming from a country and schools of people not accepting me as a dancer and to come home and just be like, here I am and I have continued doing what I\u00a0wanted to do when you all said no,\u00a0I've continued and\u00a0I\u00a0haven't given up. I'm not going to give up.\"",

      "text": "Kiwi movie-musical Daffodils will open in New Zealand cinemas on March 21 next year.\n\nThe Greatest Showman, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, A Star is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\nThis has been a stellar year for the movie musical, with the above quartet all looking set to be amongst the biggest earners of 2018 at the New Zealand box office.\n\nHowever, for Kiwi fans of the genre, there's even more exciting news. In 2019, we'll finally be getting our own homegrown big-screen musical.\n\nBased on the popular stage show of the same name, Daffodils is set to debut in New Zealand cinemas on March 21. Written by Rochelle Bright (the author of the original play, which was first staged in 2014), who was inspired by her own parents' love story, it will feature some of Kiwi music's most beloved songs, from artists like Crowded House, The Muttonbirds and Bic Runga. The cast includes iZombie's Rose McIver, Home and Away's George Mason and Kiwi popstar Kimbra.\n\nRose McIver and George Mason will star in the Kiwi movie-musical Daffodils.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Kimbra,\u00a0iZombie's\u00a0Rose\u00a0McIver\u00a0to star in Kiwi musical feature Daffodils\n\n*\u00a0Bohemian Rhapsody: Irritating, occasionally\u00a0unforgiveable\u00a0and an absolute blast\n\n*\u00a0I watched all four A Star Is Born movies - here's the messed-up reason it keeps resonating\n\n*\u00a0Daffodils searches for extras\n\nSpeaking after the release of the movie's first trailer on Wednesday afternoon, Daffodils' producer Richard Fletcher admits\u00a0it was funny how \"all the stars have aligned\" for the movie, with viewer interest in cinematic musicals currently skyhigh.\n\n\"It's extraordinary, because when we started developing the stage show as a film [in 2016], we had no idea this would happen. La La Land hadn't even come out.\"\n\nFilming took place at Wellington's Avalon Studios, in the Wairarapa and parts of the Waikato over eight weeks last summer, with Fletcher describing it as broadening, but in no way changing the essence of the much-loved play.\n\n\"Obviously the stage show was essentially a two-hander, with the only other character the narrator\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the one that Kimbra plays in the movie. We've added in a lot more characters, friends, the leads' parents\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to create a wider pool and wider storylines, but it's still very true to the play.\"\n\nBilled as \"a play with songs\", Daffodils was first staged in 2014.\n\nAssisting that, Fletcher believes, was having Bright onboard as screenwriter and Lips (Stephanie Brown\u00a0and Fen Ikner), who were also part of the original stage show, looking after the movie's score.\n\n\"So there's has been great continuity. We have 17 songs in the film, three of which are originals from the Silver Scroll-winners Lips.\"\n\nWhen asked how easy it was to licence Kiwi classics like Chris Knox's Not Given Lightly, The Dance Exponents' I'll Say Goodbye, The Swingers' Counting the Beat and Dave Dobbyn's Language, Fletcher says\u00a0relationships established by the stage play gave them \"a head start\". \"At least when we were going to the music publishers, they knew what was involved.\"\n\nHaving worked closely with director David Stubbs' (Belief: The Possession of Janet Moses), Fletcher says, rather than been inspired by big-budget Hollywood musicals, the movie version of Daffodils was influenced by Irish indie hit Once and Ryan Gosling romantic dramas Blue Valentine and The Notebook.\n\n\"While there are a lot of songs in it, our focus has been very much on the drama and the romance of the story as well. This is not good-old 'jazz hands', the songs are very much part of our story and there are only three characters who sing.\"\n\nRochelle Bright based Daffodils on her own parents' love story.\n\nPaying tribute to his leading trio, Fletcher says\u00a0they were incredibly lucky that all of them were prepared to come home to do the movie. \"When she's not in Vancouver, Rose is based in the States, Kimbra is in New York and George is Australia-based. They all leapt at the opportunity.\n\n\"Rose and George's roles are pretty unique. Not only is there a lot of drama for them, but they also sing for a good chunk of the film, which is an exciting, but daunting prospect for any actor. We really pushed them and they absolutely rose to the challenge.\"\n\nAnd while Daffodils has been made \"first-and-foremost\" for a New Zealand audience, Fletcher admits they all have global ambitions for it. An Australian release later in 2019 is already on the cards and he won't rule out the film debuting at either the prestigious Sundance or Berlin film festivals early in the year.\n\n\"It's one of those classic cases where it's a story that is so local, it's universal.\"\n\nTodd Emerson and Colleen Davis were the stars of the original stage version of Daffodils.\n\nWhile excited at the prospect of sharing his \"baby\" with the world, Fletcher admits to feeling the pressure of not only being New Zealand's first fully-fledged movie musical, but also coming out amid the current flurry of Hollywood examples of the genre.\n\n\"There is a very high bar and because there is no local comparison, people will naturally be comparing us with international productions \u2013\u00a0as they should. Also, the music we've used is very iconic, so people will have strong feelings and affiliations with those songs. But I think the time is right for this, in terms of the subject matter and given how well the stage show was received and the following it had.\"",

      "text": "Johnny Depp has accused Amber Heard of hitting him with a \u201chaymaker\u201d punch during an altercation near the end of their volatile marriage, as the star wrapped up testimony in his libel suit against a British tabloid newspaper.\n\nDepp says the fight came after Heard\u2019s 30th birthday party, and hours after he learned that his former business managers had absconded with hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper\u2019s executive editor Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a \u201cwife-beater\u201d.\n\nDepp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in 2015.\n\nHeard, a model and actor, filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalised in 2017.\n\nThe actor said just before Heard\u2019s 30th birthday party in April 2016 he attended a meeting and was told his former business managers had \u201cstolen my money\u201d.\n\nAsked how much was stolen, Depp said \u201cthis is a ludicrous amount to have to state, it\u2019s quite embarrassing \u2014 apparently I had made $US650 million ($A931 million)\u201d, much of it through his involvement with the Pirates of the Caribbean films.\n\nDepp added that in addition to losing the $US650 million he was \u201c$US100 million ($A143 million) in the hole because they had not paid the government my taxes for 17 years\u201d.\n\nDepp and his former business managers settled a legal dispute over the alleged fraud in 2018.\n\nDepp alleges that after the party he went to bed to read, and Heard began accusing him of ruining her birthday dinner before throwing a \u201chaymaker\u201d at him.\n\nDepp\u2019s lawyer David Sherborne asked him to explain the American slang term for judge Andrew Nicol.\n\n\u201cA haymaker is a type of a wild swing, a roundhouse punch. Effective if it reaches the target,\u201d Depp said on Monday.\n\n\u201cI have come across it,\u201d noted the judge.\n\nHeard is attending the three-week trial and is scheduled to give her own version of events later.\n\nDuring five days in the witness box, Depp depicted a tumultuous relationship with Heard during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol, and sometimes lapsing.\n\nHe called the relationship \u201ca crime scene waiting to happen\u201d.\n\nBut he denied Heard\u2019s claims that he slapped, hit, headbutted and threw things at her, and accused the model-actor of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d.\n\nThe Sun\u2019s defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp\u2019s violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.",

Can you believe it?\u201d\n\nOn her Instagram stories on the weekend, Osbourne posted a picture of a a clothing label in a size 26 and acknowledged the \u201chard\u201d work it took to shed the kilos.\n\n\u201cYes I\u2019m bragging because I worked hard and it feels good!!!\u201d she wrote next to the pic.\n\nOsbourne, who is the daughter of US rocker Ozzy, has long been outspoken about her weight struggles.\n\nIn 2009, after a stint in rehab for drug issues, she told how her weight increased.\n\n\u201cI replaced the drugs with food and just got fatter and fatter,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI'm an emotional eater. When I get upset, my diet goes out the window.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Ozzy shocked fans this year after opening up about his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis, which he discovered after suffering a fall last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a death sentence by any stretch of the imagination but it does effect the nerves in your body. It\u2019s like you\u2019ll have a good day, then a good day and then a really bad day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo hide something is hard \u2013 you never feel proper. You feel guilty. I\u2019m no good with secrets. I cannot walk around with it anymore. It\u2019s like I\u2019m running out of excuses.\u201d",

Her Spray Aus fake tan business partners Bec Judd and Ellie Pearson and other influencers including Emma Hawkins, Martha Kalifatidis were all among those to offer words of support.\n\nPearson is understood to be the friend who accidentally posted the snorting video to Instagram, sparking the scandal.\n\nHer last post before going to ground was an apology to her followers, admitting she had let them down with her actions.\n\n\u201cI take full responsibility and I am committed to taking all necessary steps to ensure I make better choices in future,\u201d an embarrassed and remorseful Bartel said.\n\n\u201cI am truly and deeply sorry. I hope I can earn your forgiveness and, in time, your trust.\u201d\n\nPOLICE CONFIRM NADIA BARTEL WILL NOT BE CHARGED OVER \u2018SNORTING\u2019 VIDEO\n\nBartel did not face criminal charges because police said they could not confirm what the white substance was, however she was was hit with a big fine for breaching COVID restrictions after the video of her snorting white powder emerged online.\n\nShe and three others were issued penalty infringement notices worth a whopping $5452 for attending an illegal gathering at a Richmond address.\n\nThe scandal cost Bartel dearly in other ways too, with a number of sponsors dropping her in the days after news of the scandal broke.",

      "text": "Ivanka Trump enjoyed some quality time with her 10-year-old daughter Arabella on Thursday while taking\u00a0her to a circus performance school in Miami, Florida.\n\nThe\u00a0former White House senior adviser was dressed casually in a navy hooded sweatshirt and matching navy and black leggings, which she paired with $140 black Mizuno running sneakers.\n\nIvanka, 40, was makeup-free and had her long blonde hair pulled back in a messy braid as she dropped off her daughter at\u00a0Cirque Art Studio in North Miami Beach for a class.\n\nShe didn't appear to have any jewelry on aside from the white gold band on her ring finger and the red string bracelet she often wears on her left wrist.\n\nAlthough she hasn't spoken about its purpose, it does bear a resemblance to the type of red string that Kabbalah practitioners wear to ward off the 'evil eye.'\n\nWhen she was first daughter, she used to wear designer outfits to participate in roundtable talks and events, but she now favors athleisure as she continues to live a quieter life in the Sunshine state.\n\nWhile the mom waited for Arabella's class to end, she ran to a nearby Starbucks to grab two strawberry Pink Drinks, one for her daughter and one for her friend. Her AirPods were visible in her ears as she left the coffee chain with a drink in each of her hands.\n\nIvanka took a sip of one of the drinks \u2014 presumably Arabella's \u2014 before picking up her lookalike daughter, who was dressed in a black polo shirt, light blue shorts, and sporty sneakers.\n\nShe had her cellphone and car keys in her hand as she met up with Arabella, who happily drank her Pink Drink while talking with friends at the end of class.\n\nCircus school is just one of the many new activities Arabella has had the opportunity to participate in since her family relocated from Washington, D. C. to Florida.\n\nShe and her brothers Joseph, eight, and Theodore, five, are currently enrolled in a local Jewish school that is located just a short distance from Arte Surfside, their luxury oceanfront condo building in Miami.\n\nIvanka converted to Judaism to marry her husband Jared Kushner, who is a Modern Orthodox Jew, and they are raising their children in the same faith.\n\nWhile living in Miami, the parents have taken their kids boogie boarding, go-kart racing, and tubing on a speedboat as they continue to enjoy Florida's year-long balmy weather.\n\nIvanka and Jared have kept out of the public eye over the past year and are typically only seen out during family outings with their three kids.\n\nThis is a marked change from their lives in Washington, D. C. when they were regularly photographed in their upscale neighborhood.\n\nIvanka's new home, Arte Surfside,\u00a0is one of the most expensive complexes in Miami, with an average rental price of nearly $47,000 per month.\n\nIts penthouse sold for $33 million to an unnamed private equity executive from New York last January \u2014 the same month that Ivanka and her family moved into the building.\n\nIvanka and Jared are said to be using the large, unfurnished unit as a temporary home while they build a property on a two-acre plot they purchased on Indian Creek Island for $32.2 million in December 2020.\n\nThey also scooped up an additional $24 million mansion just a few blocks away, which they are reported to have bought last April, according to the real estate website The Real Deal.\n\nThe couple's new property splurge features six bedrooms, eight and a half bathrooms, and was once owned by Spanish singer Julio Iglesias. However, until it's fixed up, they will likely remain\u00a0in their Arte Surfside condo.\n\nRenovations are now underway to transform their new $24 million mansion\u00a0located on Biscayne Bay, which sits on the exclusive Indian Creek Island. The residential village is\u00a0colloquially referred to as the 'Billionaire Bunker' because of its incredibly wealthy residents.\n\nAerial images show Ivanka and Jared's property being gutted and in a state of disarray as builders set to work on transforming the mansion.\n\nThe mansion's pool is completely removed and metal poles are poking out of the ground as the waterfront home undergoes renovation.\n\nThe renovations come just days after images revealed newly-retired NFL star Tom Brady and his wife Gisele Bundchen are having their mansion re-constructed on the island.\n\nThe couple\u00a0reportedly paid more than $17 million for their Indian Creek mansion and are now having the current house demolished to make way for a new 'eco-friendly' home, Page Six\u00a0reported.\n\nIvanka and Jared share the island\u00a0with a host of other A-listers, including hotel magnate Jeffrey Soffer, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, Haitian billionaire Gilbert Bigio, former Sears CEO Edward Lampert, and former United Airways chief executive Rakesh Gangwal.\n\nAlso among the island's residents are Hotels.com founder Robert Diener and Marquis Bank chairman Javier J. Holtz.\n\nIndian Creek, which is known as 'the world's most exclusive municipality,' has only 34 homes, around 42 residents, and its own private 13-person police force, as well as a 24-hour marine patrol to keep an eye on the water surrounding the neighborhood.\n\nEach home on Indian Creek is built around the perimeter of the island to ensure that all residents have a waterfront view. In the center of the village resides\u00a0the luxurious Indian Creek Country Club and an 18-hole golf course.\n\nIvanka may be living the high life in Florida, but she is still a person of interest in New York Attorney General Letitia James' investigation into the Trump Organization.\n\nJames is investigating whether her father, former President Donald Trump, committed fraud by misrepresenting his company's asset values.\n\nEarlier this month,\u00a0James filed a court document in which it was revealed that the former Ivanka was given the option to buy a luxury apartment from the Trump Organization for a third of the value listed on company financial statements.\n\nThe details were released in a court filing as part of an attempt to persuade a New York State judge to allow James to compel former President Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Ivanka to testify under oath.\n\nJames' probe is ongoing and is taking place as Trump is positioning himself for a potential run to try to recapture the White House in 2024.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was exclusively revealed by DailyMail.com that Trump and his family have accused James of breaking state laws for a politically motivated 'fishing expedition' in a fiery court filing.\n\nThe legal complaint, filed by Trump's lawyers in New York, claims James was hell-bent on prosecuting the Trumps even before she got into office or saw any evidence against them and has used her AG investigation into the family firms to raise money for her political campaigns.\n\nThe lawyers allege she breached the New York constitution by colluding with the state's former District Attorney Cyrus Vance to run parallel criminal and civil cases, which they claim precludes the chance for a fair trial in either.\n\nThe Trump family also claims James broke Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules, which ban campaigning on the promise of a criminal investigation.\n\nThe documents are the latest in a bitter legal battle between the former Republican president and the Democrat attorney general.\n\nFor the most part, Ivanka has chosen not to comment publicly on the ongoing investigation, nor has she involved herself in her father's ongoing political work.\n\nInstead, she has chosen to hunker down in Miami with her family and launch her own charitable food donation initiative.\n\nThe former first daughter returned to Instagram for the first time in eight months on January 18 to launch the program, which is part of a collaboration with billionaire Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya.\n\nIvanka shared several images of herself during a trip to Rochester in upstate New York, where she spent a day handing out fruits and vegetables to families in need.\n\n'Thank you to our many incredible partners and volunteers who helped feed tens of thousands American families across Idaho and NY, with fresh, nutritious, locally-sourced produce and dairy this holiday season,' she wrote.\n\nThe partnership with Chobani founder Ulukaya \u2014 who is estimated to be worth $2.3 billion according to Forbes \u2014 is surprising considering his criticism of Ivanka's father at the beginning of his term.\n\nIn an internal memo leaked to CNN in 2017, Ulukaya, took issue with Trump's travel ban from predominantly Muslim countries.\n\n'This is very personal for me,' Ulukaya, a Kurd from Turkey, wrote. 'As an immigrant who came to this country looking for opportunity, it's very difficult to think about and imagine what millions of people around the world must be feeling right now.\n\n'America has always been a symbol of hope, tolerance, and diversity \u2014 and these are values we must work very hard to uphold,' he wrote, offering to help employees whose families were impacted by the ban.\n\nThe criticism goes in both directions. In 2016, some far-right conservatives called for a boycott against Chobani over Ulukaya's practice of hiring refugees.\n\nYet Ivanka appears to have a cordial relationship with Ulukaya, and she referenced a lunch she shared with him last year where the pair planned their food-donation initiative across New York and Idaho.",

      "text": "Some celebrities are just walking memes. You know, the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Ryan Gosling and even Paul Pogba. Just look at Leo as he raises his glass for a toast in The Great Gatsby. That swagger. It\u2019s natural. And who could forget that look, you know, the scene where he is dying in Titanic.\n\nPogba took his time with a penalty kick in a game against Everton, taking even longer than for Usain Bolt to run the 100m. The number of steps the Frenchman took was a staggering 28.\n\nAnd Ryan. Oh, Ryan. Just google images for \u201cHey Girl\u201d.\n\nThose were perhaps some of the biggest internet moments.\n\nThat was until last week though.\n\nFormer prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak may have surpassed them all when he stormed out midway through an interview with Al-Jazeera.\n\nCertainly, many in Malaysia think he takes the cake.\n\nHow did he do it? Here is a list of invaluable tips we gathered from our review of the interview. (Before you cry fake news, look for the video links for this is as real as it gets.)\n\n1) \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Use strong words. Don\u2019t settle for anything less than controversial, such as labelling your interviewer a \u201cnuisance\u201d. When the interviewer, Mary Ann Jolley, asked Najib why she was deported for merely wanting to file a report on the Altantuya case, he is candid in his reply: \u201cIt\u2019s good that we deported you. You\u2019re a nuisance.\u201d\n\n2) \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Stand up when you threaten to walk out. We\u2019re sure this will be a classic. After about 20 minutes of questions on all manner of things, including Altantuya and 1MDB, Najib, who must have felt the interview was going off-tangent to his thoughts on pump-priming, stood up and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m done ... (but) if you are going to talk about the economy, I\u2019ll sit down.\u201d\n\n3) \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Demand fairness in a raised tone. If you are a former head of government, you are obviously entitled to it. Mid-way through the interview, Najib bristles, \u201cCome on, you\u2019re not being fair to me!\u201d\n\n4) \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Watch your interviewer cagily in case she is trying to catch you off-guard. Cock your head to one side and train your eyes on her.\n\n5) \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Everyone deserves a second chance. After Jolley pacified Najib, he decided she deserved another chance and returned to his seat, albeit reluctantly.\n\nIt helped that she had assured him the next question would be on the economy. Well, it was before she launched, yet again, into 1MDB.\n\n6) \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Be proud of your legacy, even if in the end, it is sadly tainted. \u201cI regret it ... I wish there was no 1MDB issue whatsoever,\u201d Najib conceded on the monumental failure of the so-called wealth fund established under his watch.\n\n7) \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Walk out of the interview with a smile even though you are seething inside. When the questions return to 1MDB and Jho Low, Najib stood up and finally took his leave as soon as the microphone on his lapel was removed by his aide.\n\nThe want-to-walkout-but-maybe-not-and-eventually-walkout moment was quickly captured on the internet. Rather bravely, Najib himself included a link of the video for his Facebook and Twitter followers. International media organisation Al-Jazeera posted it as well on YouTube and its website with the brief title: \u201cNajib speaks\u201d.\n\nSo the next time an interview goes off-script, don\u2019t worry. You might just be the next celebrity meme.",

      "text": "By Latha Srinivasan: With Thiruchitrambalam from Sun Pictures starring Dhanush, Nithya Menen and Bharathiraja striking gold at the box office in 2022, the Gray Man star is on a roll. The latest reports emerging from the Tamil film industry stated that he will turn director now for Sun Pictures. The movie will star Dhanush, SJ Suryaj and Vishu Vishal. NO news of any leading lady is out yet.\n\nThis new movie should go on floors in the next few months since Dhanush's Vaathi is releasing on February 17 and Captain Miller shortly after that.\n\nREAD I Dhanush\u2019s Captain Miller is going to blow your mind. Sundeep Kishan tells you why\n\nDhanush is a highly talented actor who has made some fantastic films that earned him a National Award as well. In 2022, the actor had three Tamil releases - Thirchitrambalam, naan Varuven and Maaran. He had one Hollywood film release - The Gray Man - which was produced and released on Neflix.\n\nNow, Dhanush also has the sequel to The Gray Man with Ryan Gosling.\n\nIt is reported that Dhaunush's production house Wunderbar FIlms had signed on Vishnu Vishal for a film. Dhanush disbanded his production company after incurring losses and it looks like he has roped in Vishnu for this new project with Sun Pictures as a result.\n\nThe Aaduklam star had started work on another film as director, titled Naan Rudran in 2020.

      "text": "Sandra Bullock has made a name for herself in Hollywood based around her likability. The queen of romantic comedies gives the impression of being approachable while still being attractive. However, her love life has not always been the stuff of movies!\n\nSandra Bullock\u2019s dating history is filled with a wide variety of men. From a very publicized marriage \u2014and subsequent breakup\u2014 to romances with co-stars, Bullock has interesting taste when it comes to men. The Oscar-winning actress appears to finally have everything figured out at long last, but let\u2019s see how!\n\nHere is everything you\u2019ve always wanted to know about Sandra Bullock\u2019s dating history.\n\nSandra Bullock is not currently married.\n\nShe was previously married to auto mechanic and TV personality Jesse James for almost five years. The pair first met when Bullock arranged for a tour of his garage for her nephew back in 2003. In 2005, the duo married.\n\nAll seemed well until 2010, 10 days after Bullock accepted her first Oscar: News broke that tattoo artist Michelle \"Bombshell\" McGee had gone public with an affair she had been having with James while Bullock was on set filming The Blind Side.\n\nTwo more women came forward with their own allegations of James\u2019 infidelity during his marriage to Bullock, leading to her filing for a divorce a month after the allegations first came to light. The couple had actually just finished the process of adopting a child together when this drama ensued, a son named Louis, making their divorce all the more complicated. Bullock adopted a second child, this time as a single parent, a daughter named Laila, in 2015.\n\nRelated: Mistress to Sandra Bullock: 'Sorry About the Affair'\n\nSandra Bullock has been married once, to auto mechanic and TV personality Jesse James from 2005 to 2010. Unfortunately, the marriage ended due to James\u2019 infidelity. Some men don\u2019t know a good thing when they have it!\n\nSandra Bullock has been dating her boyfriend Bryan Randall since 2015. By all accounts, the couple is still together and very happy, but they are in no rush to get married any time soon.\n\nSandra Bullock is not married to her boyfriend Bryan Randall, though the two have been together since 2015. They met when Randall photographed Bullock\u2019s son\u2019s birthday in January 2015 and began dating shortly after. A source told Us Weekly that the pair is \u201ctotally open\u201d to tying the knot one day, but they are not in a rush to do so. On Facebook\u2019s Red Table Talk, Bullock called Randall \u201cthe love of my life.\u201d Glad to see you so happy, Sandy!\n\nRelated: 5 Things You Didn't Know About Sandra Bullock\n\nSandra Bullock is in a relationship with photographer Bryan Randall. The pair have been dating since 2015, after meeting when Bullock hired Randall to photograph her son\u2019s birthday. They even moved in together after less than a year of dating. The seven-year relationship appears to be loving and healthy.\n\nSandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves formed an enduring friendship while filming 1994\u2019s Speed, the movie that made Bullock a star. The friendship has endured to this day. The pair reunited for 2006\u2019s The Lake House, though they shared very little screen time in the romance. Even so, the duo have been very vocal about their friendship and appreciation for one and other.\n\nIn fact, both have revealed in interviews over the years that they did in fact have a crush on the other during the filming of Speed. However, the romance was not meant to be it appears and a decades-long friendship has formed in its place.\n\nSandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds appeared in 2009\u2019s The Proposal as romantic interests. However, according to rumors,\u00a0the duo reportedly did not date until two years later in 2011, after Reynolds\u2019 divorce from Scarlett Johansson and Bullock\u2019s divorce from Jesse James. But,\u00a0neither has ever confirmed the romance and Bullock has referred to Reynolds as just a friend.\n\nSandra Bullock is around 12 years older than her The Proposal co-star Ryan Reynolds. The two are rumored to have dated, but that is still unconfirmed.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s the Perfect Date to Rewatch Some of Sandra Bullock\u2019s Best Movies!\n\nRyan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock appear to still be on friendly terms with each other. As recently as 2013, Reynolds said he would love to do another movie with Bullock. Reynolds was supposed to appear opposite Bullock in the 2022 movie The Lost City, but sadly the re-teaming did not happen and Channing Tatum was cast instead. We\u2019ll keep our fingers crossed that they appear together in another project soon!\n\nSandra Bullock has dated a few notable names in addition to the ones we have already discussed. Bullock dated her Love Potion No. 9 co-star Tate Donovan from 1990 to 1994, with Bullock reportedly taking the breakup of the long-term relationship hard.\n\nThe following year, she was linked to football player Troy Aikman, but never officially confirmed the relationship. The duo were also reportedly romantically linked almost a decade later in 2014, but again, did not confirm anything.\n\nAlso in 1995, Bullock was also rumored to be dating film tech Don Padilla, who is thought to be the person she was referencing when she said in a 1996 interview that she had been dating someone for 10 months.\n\nAround the time they co-starred in 1996\u2019s A Time to Kill, it would appear that Bullock and Matthew McConaughey entered into a two-year relationship, which both kept low key. However, Bullock did not correct Cosmopolitan when he was referred to as her ex-boyfriend during an interview in 2003.\n\nSpeaking of Texans, Bullock also dated Austin-based musician Bob Schneider for around two years from 1999 to 2001.\n\nBullock famously dated her Murder By Numbers co-star Ryan Gosling after meeting on set in 2001. The couple had a 16-year age difference between them, with Bullock being 37 and Gosling being 21, but they still managed to last for close to two years, from 2001 to 2003.",

It was so wonderful, she is so generous and generous with her time and energy. She brought so much fun to set because it\u2019s kind of a dark show\u2026 so it was nice. She made everyone feel so safe and welcome. We had a really good time which was really important because the show covers such heavy things.\u201d\n\nAs for that intimate scene in a car, it\u2019s actually pretty heartwarming.\n\nStream Mare of Easttown on BINGE from April 19. New customers get a 14-day free trial. Sign up at binge.com.au\n\n\u201cIt was an intimate scene between me and another girl, and it was the other girl\u2019s first day. It was in a car, so it was me, this other girl, two cameramen in the back, and then Kate hopped in the boot of the car because she wanted us to feel safe! Usually if you\u2019re in a car, they do direction over a walkie-talkie, and she didn\u2019t want it all over a walkie-talkie so she was giving us direction from the car which was so nice. It made everyone feel comfortable and we just had a laugh about it which was a good way to go about it\u201d\n\nRELATED: Why you\u2019ll be obsessed with Kate Winslet\u2019s new show\n\nWhile Rice has played various different roles, her character of Siobhan in this new series was definitely one of the hardest characters she had to portray.\n\n\u201cI think what was challenging about Siobhan is that she has gone through a lot of grief and trauma in her life and she is learning how to cope with that and express that. I think getting in that head space is quite challenging because it\u2019s quite dark and also it\u2019s hard to hold onto that over COVID. We had 8 months break between filming and I didn\u2019t want to let her go.\u201d\n\nMare of Easttown premieres on Binge on Monday, April 19",

      "tags": [],
      "text": "Copenhagen Cowboy (Netflix) is a double misnomer. There\u2019s little sign of the Danish capital. And no one rides a hoss in a Stetson or knocks up a dodgy extension. We are instead in the world of Nicolas Winding Refn. Or NWR, as the love child of Tarantino and Lynch is styled in the credits for this hypnotic shaggy dog story.\n\nThis is the Danish auteur\u2019s first work not in English since the Pusher crime trilogy which announced him as a wunderkind in the mid-1990s. You know where you aren\u2019t with NWR: you\u2019re nowhere near the real world of jobs, shops and lattes. Best known for putting Ryan Gosling in a fast car in Drive, his oeuvre is steeped in the mythic DNA of violence and vengeance.\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of women among his stories of gangland hardmen and ripped vigilantes, or not ones with any agency. For his previous film, a horror movie set in the world of fashion and beauty, he asked the British playwright Polly Stenham aboard to deal with that side of things. But this all changes with Copenhagen Cowboy, whose female protagonist is an unsexualised androgyne exuding an enigmatic potency.\n\nWe begin, unpromisingly, in a piggery. To a soundtrack of porcine squeals a woman in stiletto slingbacks is being slowly throttled. We don\u2019t see all her face, or her killer\u2019s. After this queasy amuse-bouche, a winking citation of every other misogynistic crime drama, we cut to a car gliding through the rural night. In the back is a woman with huge eyes, short hair and an impassive expression that you\u2019d better get used to because, but for the odd flicker of a smile, it barely changes for the next six episodes.\n\nViewers will be divided over whether there is any substance with the style\n\nMiu, played by a bewitching Angela Bundalovic, seems to be some sort of lucky charm, hired by a Serbian woman long past her fertile peak to bless her loins and make her pregnant. The childless woman turns out to be the sister of a brutal pimp who runs a countryside brothel. It\u2019s no wonder she can\u2019t conceive: her bloated husband oinks like a stuck pig.\n\nThose animal noises are the first overt sign of many that Miu isn\u2019t in the Denmark of Sarah Lund and Birgitte Nyborg. Refn locates his story in vast empty rooms that might be anywhere \u2013 a remote warehouse, a baronial castle, a drive-by restaurant. To disorient you further, he washes every interior in red or blue filters, spins his camera in circles as if on a merry-go-round, or immobilises it for so long that his shots look like album cover stills.\n\nThe camera holds longest on Miu\u2019s gimlet stare as if attempting to peer into her soul. \u201cYou\u2019re a strange one,\u201d she is told. Who is she really? As her story unfurls in a picaresque journey through the criminal underworld (she escapes from the brothel by the end of the first episode), Miu could be anything: an elfin clairvoyant, a ninja sprite, a trafficked vampire, a woman who fell to earth. She could even be a cowboy, sent to avenge her sex for the sins of men. All muscles and tats, pates and manes, toxic machismo is on display in myriad forms: a Serbian pimp, a Chinese crime boss, a Danish lord of the manor who preaches the primal power of the c--k to his murderous son.\n\nThe sort-of-persuasive plot, which could easily be wrapped up in an hour, is secondary to style. Miu\u2019s supernatural origin story really only solidifies in the final episode, by which time some viewers will have lost patience with the narrative\u2019s glacial tread and aura of self-love. If you stick with it, consenting to be mesmerised if also baffled, be warned that Copenhagen Cowboy is like many other supernatural odysseys which get lost in their own maze. It has no idea how to end other than to shrug and raise a single, massively irritating digit in the direction of the viewer.",

      "text": "A Wellington video store has come up with a creative solution to help keep its doors open - adoption.\n\nThe Aro St Video Shop last week introduced an Adopt-a-Movie\u00a0scheme, where the public can exclusively sponsor any film in\u00a0its more than 23,000 strong collection, or help buy a proposed new acquisition movie. Adoption prices range from $20 to $35.\n\nAro Video owner Andrew Armitage says that as the \"parent\" of a film, the adopter is entitled to free lifetime rental of the film and receives a certificate and naming rights, both on the physical DVD case and the store's web page.\n\nHe says it was conceived as a way to keep purchasing a breadth of interesting titles, in the face of ever-declining resources.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Wellington's Aro Video saved from closure\n\n*\u00a0Another once beloved United Video store closes doors for last time\n\n\"We simply wanted to keep adding interesting, imported titles to the library, but haven't been able to afford them, or the cost of having them rated, or classified.\n\nAs the \"parent\" of a film, an adopter is entitled to free lifetime rental of the film and receives a certificate and naming rights, both on the physical DVD case and the store's web page.\n\n\"The scheme allows us to be more responsive to customer requests. Instead of saying 'no', we can give them an option if they'd like to see it in the library.\"\n\nArmitage says the idea was originally mooted around a year ago, around the same time as the store's immediate future was only secured via the introduction an annual subscription scheme, but it has taken this long to get \"everything lined-up on a shoestring budget\".\n\nHe says that, \"funnily enough\", some customers had been in during that time suggesting that they would be prepared to fund a particular title they were desperate to see.\n\nEncouraged by the feedback and uptake so far, he's been particularly impressed by how it has attracted attention on social media.\n\n\"It was definitely a gamble. You definitely can't assume people aren't going to pick on it because you're asking them for more money. But what's really been interesting is when somebody has been enthusiastic about supporting the cause, they've immediately told others about it. Some people have challenged others to match them.\n\n\"I think the voice of the crowd is more potent than just an appeal from us. We are lucky enough to be in a position where we have a crowd of loyal supporters who are on board in terms of hearts and minds and we can use them in a way that helps sustain us longer term. Hopefully this will result in,\u00a0rather than fewer customers renting more often,\u00a0a much wider variety of customers perhaps renting less often.\"\n\nAro Video have been a vital part of the Aro Valley community for more than 25 years.\n\nArmitage says the current membership level is around 70,000, with 16,000 subscribed to Aro's online \"newsletter\". And while they received an influx of \"refugees\" from other, now defunct video stores over the summer period, that was somewhat offset by those deciding to \"experiment\" with streaming services. \"It is a constant challenge to keep the boat afloat,\" he admits.\n\nHowever, bolstered by the enthusiasm around the new scheme, Armitage says he has been reinvigorated to start researching the availability of more classic and obscure titles and battling the \"outdated\" Film &Video Publication Classifications Act 1993.\n\n\"I'd estimate there to be several hundred titles a year that are denied a DVD release because of the prohibitive costs of the archaic DVD classification process, and every year is worse than the last. This is of constant aggravation to customers who simply want to watch quality film and TV for mature audiences. It actually breaks my heart when a title like the Danish TV series Follow the Money is not going to be released because the distributors cannot justify the obligatory $3000 to have it classified by the OFLC\u00a0[Office of Film & Literature Classification].\n\nLong-time Aro St fan Rebecca McMillan was one of the first to sign up for \"movie adoption\".\u00a0 Always keen to support the store in whatever way she could, McMillan says she got in early because she wanted to make sure she secured 2011 film Drive.\n\n\"Some people may choose a\u00a0classic like Citizen Kane or The Shawshank Redemption, but I wanted to ensure a modern classic would forever be available. It has a special place in my heart. The film is an adrenaline rush, Ryan Gosling plays a Hollywood stunt driver by day and a getaway car driver by night and it has a\u00a0 killer soundtrack. It's got surprising ultra-violent moments and it has Ryan Gosling in it.\"\n\nFree lifetime rental of it was just the cherry-on-top for her, McMillan says, \"having my name next to Ryan Gosling is priceless\".\n\nAro Video owner Andrew Armitage says the current membership level is around 70,000, with 16,000 subscribed to Aro's online \"newsletter\".\n\nDescribing the store as a \"national treasure\", she says that while online viewing continues to grow, she believes that we're going to see a renaissance in physical film media in the same way that vinyl has endured.\n\n\"Being able to read the DVD slip, appreciate the artwork and browse special features are things I enjoy doing. Personally, I'm less inclined to possess movies these\u00a0days, but I really want to ensure that there's a\u00a0library that endures, so I can access the movies as I want. Online services curate the selection that we are allowed to see.\u00a0Aro has thousands more titles available than any of them.\"\n\nFind out more about adopting a movie from Aro Video here.\n\nWhich movie would you adopt?

On January 1, Alphonse took to social media to write his wishlist and he had a huge one for the RRR director. Alphonse wrote that he wanted to see Rajamouli remake his hit film Vikramarkudu in English and that too in Hollywood!\n\nThe Gold director wrote, \"Want to See SS Rajamouli Remake Vikramarkudu in English with the College Pappala Bus Song in Today's Style with Actors like Jackie Chan or Will Smith or Ryan Gosling with Scarlett Johanson or any Actresses suitable for it.\"\n\nRajamouli has been having a dream run with RRR which is now up for awards at the Golden Globes as well as the Oscars. The Indian audience is hoping that they come back with awards.\n\nAlphonse Puthren, however, had a bad 2022 when his Gold starring Prithviraj bombed badly. He came back with a film six years after Aviyal and the disaster did not help him. His film Premam, which released in 2015 became a cult film and it ran in Chennai theatres for more than 100 days. This is not a simple feat in this day and age.\n\nHis fans are hoping that he makes a good comeback soon. Here's wishing him the best in 2023.",

      "text": "Winston Duke\u2019s net worth reflects the fact that he is a star on the rise. When he first caught worldwide attention in 2018\u2019s Black Panther, it was clear he had charisma and talent. And Hollywood certainly agrees as the actor has starred in a slew of projects since.\n\nFrom his role in 2019\u2019s Us to his most recent appearance in this year\u2019s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Duke has shown he can be equal parts funny and intense. That combo has kept us coming back for more. So, we gotta hope he\u2019s making bank for his stellar work!\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Winston Duke\u2019s net worth.\n\nRelated: Everything We Know About Ironheart\n\nWinston Duke has only been in the spotlight for a few years now, but he worked hard to get there! Originally born in Argyle, Saint Paul, Tobago, he moved to the states with his family when he was nine years old. It may come as a surprise that the broad-shouldered funnyman is actually a graduate of the Yale School of Drama, where he left with a Master of Fine Arts in acting in 2013. While at Yale, he formed a friendship with fellow student and future co-star Lupita Nyong\u2019o.\n\nHe booked roles onstage in theater productions before he landed his first major onscreen role, a recurring appearance on Person of Interest in 2014. He followed this with other guest starring roles on shows like The Messengers, Major Crimes and Modern Family. However, it would be his casting as M\u2019Baku in 2018\u2019s Black Panther that would truly be Winston Duke\u2019s breakout role, landing him a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Fight for his face off against Chadwick Boseman in the film.\n\nSince then, Duke has been in demand in Hollywood, reprising the role of M\u2019Baku in 2018\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War, 2019\u2019s Avengers: Endgame and 2022\u2019s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (in which his role was reportedly boosted following the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman in 2020). He also landed the leading male role in Jordan Peele\u2019s follow-up horror film to 2017\u2019s Get Out, 2019\u2019s Us. Let\u2019s hope he keeps working at that rate!\n\nRelated:\u00a0Like a Queen! Angela Bassett\u2019s Net Worth In 2022 Earns Her the Royal Treatment in Real Life\n\nThere isn\u2019t much information about Winston Duke\u2019s net worth online due to his relatively new status in the entertainment industry. However, multiple reports list Duke\u2019s net worth as $8 million. He has earned his money mainly from his roles as an actor, especially in movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nIt has been reported that Winston Duke has an annual income of about $1 million. However, this number will vary depending on the number of projects he has undertaken and their various budgets. Still, this is definitely the salary of a star on the rise!\n\nWinston Duke was originally born in Tobago, making him Tobagonian-Trinidadian-American. He relocated with his family to the states when he was 9.\n\nIt is not surprising that fans are curious about Winston Duke\u2019s height as he does appear to tower over many of his co-stars in his films. Duke stands at an impressive 6\u20195\u201d. Yeah, we wouldn\u2019t pick a fight with him, either!\n\nIt may surprise you to learn that Winston Duke has not appeared in that many movies. His film debut was as M\u2019Baku in 2018\u2019s Black Panther, a role he reprised the same year in Avengers: Infinity War and the following year in 2019\u2019s Avengers: Endgame. In 2019 he also appeared in Jordan Peele\u2019s Us.\n\nIn 2020, Duke had roles in Nine Days and Spenser Confidential. In 2022, fans can see him once again take on the role of M\u2019Baku in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. He is currently set to appear alongside Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt in 2024\u2019s The Fall Guy.\n\nIt is not yet 100% clear who will be taking on the Black Panther mantle moving forward now that Chadwick Boseman and his character T\u2019Challa have both tragically passed away. However, more signs point toward T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, as his successor. Duke reportedly was offered a larger role in the Black Panther sequel following Boseman\u2019s untimely passing, so it is still a possibility that he will be donning the costume. Fans will have to see Black Panther: Wakanda Forever to know for sure.\n\nIt has not yet been revealed who will be the new Black Panther following the devastating premature passing of Chadwick Boseman in 2020. However, recently, the evidence has been piling up that Boseman\u2019s character\u2019s sister Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, will be the next Black Panther. Fans won\u2019t know for sure what the MCU has planned until they see Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nRelated: Black Panther Earns Her Green! Letitia Wright\u2019s Net Worth In 2022 Would Even Shock Shuri\n\nIt is not known how much Winston Duke was paid for his role as M\u2019Baku in 2018\u2019s Black Panther. It has been reported that star Chadwick Boseman was paid $500,000 and a percentage of the film\u2019s profits for his role. As such, it would stand to reason that Duke, who was making his movie debut and had less clout and a smaller role than Boseman, would be paid significantly less. We can imagine he was paid in the high tens of thousands or low hundreds of thousands for Black Panther.\n\nRelated: How to Watch Every Marvel Movie In Order of Story\n\nIt has not been publicly revealed how much Winston Duke was paid to reprise the role of M\u2019Baku in 2018\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War. As this was only his second movie and he was not one of its main stars, we can imagine he was most likely paid in the tens of thousands for his role, the low hundred of thousands at most.\n\nWinston Duke has remained tight-lipped on his salary for 2019\u2019s Avengers: Endgame. As he had a smaller role in the film and did not have a long film resume, we can imagine he was paid in the tens of thousands or, at most, the low hundreds of thousands, to play M\u2019Baku again.\n\nNext, test your knowledge with Marvel trivia questions and answers.",

(Photo by Donato Sardella/Getty Images for New York & Company)\n\nEva Mendes is getting candid about her decision to leave the acting world behind.\n\nThe 48-year-old once dominated the big screen with roles in hits like Hitch, Ghost Rider, and 2 Fast 2 Furious, but it doesn't seem like she's planning a comeback anytime soon.\n\nIn fact, the actress\u2014whose last on-screen role was in the 2014 film Lost River\u2014 admitted that she doesn't even miss acting.\n\nWhile speaking to Variety, Mendes explained that there's nothing more to her exit from the industry other than being \"tired of fighting for the good roles.\"\n\n\"There just was a point where I thought, 'I'm going to create my own opportunities and become a producer on things and create my own material,' but it just didn't feel worth it to me,\" she added of her mindset at the time.\n\nMendes acknowledged that the industry has changed quite a bit since her departure, adding it was mostly for the better as \"there are more opportunities for Latina actresses now, but when I bowed out 10 years ago I wasn't being offered things that weren't specifically Latina.\"\n\n\"It is exciting that things are different now,\" she said, embracing an open mindset about a return to the craft while underscoring that she's also content where she's at. \"Who knows what I will do in the future. But right now, I'm keeping it in the home with my kids.\"\n\nMendes\u2014who shares two daughters, Esmeralda Amada, 7, and Amada Lee, 6, with actor Ryan Gosling\u2014said that when she stepped away from acting, she knew that focusing on her family was \"what I'm supposed to do right now.\"\n\nHowever, she's also embarked on a new business venture recently as the co-owner of kitchen cleaning company Skura Style. She also remains supportive of her partner, who is stepping into the shoes of Ken in the upcoming Barbie live-action film opposite Margot Robbie.",

      "text": "It's an unfortunate fact of biology that the older you get, the more difficult it becomes to get pregnant naturally. In fact,\u00a0Jennifer Aniston recently opened up about her fertility struggles in her late 30s and 40s\u2014even after trying IVF, she was sadly unable to get pregnant.\n\nBut just because you're in your late 30s or early 40s doesn't mean you need to rule out having a baby. In fact, more than 100,000 people over the age of 40 give birth each year\u2014and this number includes a handful of well-known celebrities. Whether through IVF, surrogacy or conceiving naturally, here are 14 celebrities who have gone through \"geriatric pregnancies\" and had babies over the age of 40.\n\nAt age 41, the actress gave birth to her daughter, Nahla, and six years later welcomed her younger son, Maceo. Being pregnant at 47 was surprising, as Berry admitted in an interview:\u00a0\u201cI was really, you know, kinda premenopausal so to have this happen was a huge [shock].\u201d\n\nAlready a mom of two, Jennifer Connelly had her sons Kai (from a prior relationship) and Stellan (with her husband Paul Bettany) before turning 40. When Connelly was 40, she and her husband welcomed a daughter Agnes Lark.\n\nRelated: 35 of the Best Baby Gift Sets You Need to Add to Your Baby Registry PRONTO!\n\nAt age 42, the actress welcomed her third child, a daughter named Rosalind Arusha Arkadina Altalune Florence Thurman-Busson (known as Luna). With her former husband Ethan Hawke, Thurman has two other children\u2014a daughter Maya and a son Levon.\n\nGeena Davis didn\u2019t become a mother until her 40s, giving birth to her first child Alizeh at 46 with her partner at the time, Reza Jarrahy. At 48, she welcomed twin boys, Kian and Kaiis. Davis and Jarrahy are no longer together.\n\nAlready a mother to two sons, Kingston and Zuma, the singer and her former husband Gavin Rossdale welcomed a third son Apollo at age 44. Stefani said in an interview that Apollo\u2019s birth was a \u201cmiracle surprise.\u201d\n\nAfter keeping her pregnancy a secret, Outlander actress Caitr\u00edona Balfe gave birth to a son at 41 with husband Tony McGill. In an Instagram post, she wrote: \u201c'I\u2019ve been off socials for a while as I was taking some time to enjoy cooking up this little human \u2026. We are so grateful for this little soul.'\u201d\n\nThe Desperate Housewives star welcomed twins Eden and Savannah at age 44 via IVF. Cross and her husband tried to conceive before getting married, but when it didn't happen immediately, they decided to pursue fertility treatments the week after their wedding.\n\nRelated: It's More Common That You Might Think\u2014Here Are 12 Celebs Who Have Gone Through IVF\n\nAt age 41, the singer gave birth to twins, a son Moroccan and a daughter, Monroe, with her then-husband, Nick Cannon. She previously experienced fertility struggles and had a miscarriage in 2008. Carey used fertility treatments and acupuncture to help her get pregnant.\n\nThe actress was 40 when she became a mother. In 2014, Mendes and her husband, Ryan Gosling, welcomed a daughter, Esmeralda. In 2016, she gave birth to another baby girl, Amada.\n\nAfter having her first child in her mid-thirties, the '80s film star suffered secondary infertility. At age 41 she became pregnant again, giving birth to twins\u2014a daughter Adele and a son Roman.\n\nAfter an ectopic pregnancy, Nicole Kidman and former husband, Tom Cruise, decided to adopt two children in the mid-90s. At 41, Kidman and her husband Keith Urban welcomed a daughter, Sunday Rose. Two years later, the couple decided to have another child through surrogacy, which resulted in another daughter, Faith Margaret.\n\nThe British actress had her first child, a son named Alexander \"Sasha\" Pete, at 38 with her boyfriend, Liev Schreiber. Then, at age 40, she gave birth to another child, Samuel Kai.\n\nAlready a mother to two daughters and a son, the Oscar-winning actress welcomed a fourth child, Louisa Jacobson at 41 (just 10 days before Streep turned 42).\n\nJackson became pregnant at age 50.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 and in 2012 underwent a bone marrow transplant for a myelodysplastic syndrome, or a group of disorders caused by improper blood cell production.\n\nIn April, Roberts told Ellen DeGeneres that the role-reversal allowed the two of them to help each other out even more. \"I'm able to kind of give her a roadmap because I've gone through it, but she's also given me a roadmap on how to be a caregiver,\" she said.\n\nRelated:\u00a0Why GMA's Robin Roberts Is Urging Women To Be Their Greatest Health Advocate\n\nUpon her return to the morning new program, Roberts spoke with Bridgerton's Reg\u00e9-Jean Page about his upcoming film The Gray Man, which also stars Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas.\n\nShe also shared a sweet post with Amber to celebrate their 17th anniversary:\n\nNext:\u00a0Nicole Scherzinger Subtly Responds After Finally Being Credited With Forming One Direction",

      "text": "As Justin Timberlake\u2019s net worth goes to show, he went from The Mickey Mouse Club to the multimillionaire club. Thanks to both his time in *NSYNC and his solo acting and singing careers, Timberlake has cemented his status as a fixture in the entertainment industry. But while the former boy band member has come a long way from his days as a young, cowboy hat-clad contender on Star Search, he remains humble when it comes to discussing his net worth.\n\n\"I grew up in Tennessee,\u201d he told The Guardian in a 2011 interview, when asked about his fortune. \u201cMy mom told me it's uncouth to talk about money. I feel weird talking about it.\"\n\nSimilarly, although he sings about getting snazzed up in a \u201cSuit and Tie,\u201d don\u2019t expect the multihyphenate to be spending on splashy styles all the time. \"I will just say that I am pretty frugal. I'll probably shop [for clothes] for myself once a year, and that will last me for the rest of the year,\u201d he added in the same interview. \u201cWhat was it that Prince said? 'Money can't buy you happiness, but it can help pay for the pursuit.\u2019\u201d\n\nKeep reading for everything we know about Justin Timberlake\u2019s net worth\u2014including whether he actually bought MySpace.\n\nPerhaps a better question would be, was Justin Timberlake ever not famous? After coming in second on Star Search at age 11, the multihyphenate rose to fame, when he started starring in The Mickey Mouse Club reboot. His co-stars also went on to become some of the entertainment industry\u2019s biggest names, including Britney Spears (who he later dated), Christina Aguilera and Ryan Gosling.\n\nTimberlake toldThe Hollywood Reporter\u00a0in 2017 that he \u201ccan't really remember not being famous.\u201d He added that he was \u201cthe age when you just soak up everything\u201d during his time in The Mickey Mouse Club, which began at age 12, telling the outlet: \u201cWe were taking acting classes, music classes, dance classes. We were learning how coverage and editing and cinematography work. And being put in front of a live audience, learning how to engage the crowd to get a laugh. Honestly, it was like SNL for children.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake's net worth is $250 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nFollowing their time as Mousketeers, Timberlake and JC Chasez joined forces with Chris Kirkpatrick, who wanted to start a boy band. They then teamed up with Joey Fatone and Lance Bass to form *NSYNC, and released their first, self-titled album in 1998. The group went on to become one of the most iconic \u201890s boy bands.\n\nTheir second album, No Strings Attached, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and sold a then-record setting 2.4 million copies in its first week, per Billboard. They kept the momentum going with their third, aptly-named album Celebrity, which also debuted at No. 1 on the charts, before selling 1.88 million copies in the first week alone.\n\nWhile the album sales were staggering, not to mention the profits from touring, Timberlake\u2019s paycheck initially wasn\u2019t as big as you\u2019d expect. The band was originally managed by Lou Pearlman, who was later convicted of crimes including money laundering and conspiracy. In The Boy Band Con: The Lou Pearlman Story, Lance Bass said he only received 10,000 for an entire album tour. \u201cI open up the envelope, I see the check, and oh, my gosh, my heart sunk,\u201d he said in the YouTube Originals documentary. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the number I was looking at. The check was $10,000. And not to sound ungrateful \u2026 but when you compare it to how many hours we had put into this group for years, it didn\u2019t even touch minimum wage. At all.\u201d In 2000, the band instead signed with Jive Records in order to keep more of their own earnings.\n\nFollowing the boy band\u2019s breakup, Timberland went on to take center stage with a solo singing career. He regularly rakes in eight-figure yearly incomes, earning $44 million in 2008, according to Forbes. In 2015, the star also came in 19th on the magazine\u2019s list of the highest-paid celebrities, thanks to his $63.5 million earnings. He came in at 40th in 2019 before dropping off the list in 2020.\n\nRelated:\u00a0Justin Timberlake Does a Completely Silent Interview on The Tonight Show\n\nTimberlake may not be in a boy band anymore, but he still has legions of fans buying tickets to his shows. His take-home pay for each show isn\u2019t publicly known and depends on the tour; according to Forbes, his total ticket sales for his 2008 tour reached $100 million, with 2 million tickets sold. He made even more during the Man of the Woods tour in 2018, which the outlet reports made $225 million from 115 shows and 1.7 million tickets sold.\n\nHaving performed at the Big Game on three separate occasions, Justin Timberlake is tied with Gloria Estefan for the most Super Bowl performances of all time. He hit the stage with *NSYNC and Aerosmith in 2001, followed by that notorious halftime show with Janet Jackson in 2004, where she suffered an infamous wardrobe malfunction. Later, in 2018, he scored his own headlining spot. Despite being a fixture of the football stadium show, Timberlake hasn\u2019t been paid for his appearances. As a rule, the NFL reportedly pays for stars\u2019 travel and performance costs, but doesn\u2019t give them any take-home earnings.\n\nYep! According to the New York Daily News, the superstar couple has a prenup, which reportedly includes a clause stating that Biel would receive $500,000 if Timberlake were unfaithful.\n\nRelated:\u00a0Justin Timberlake Woke Up Jessica Biel By Singing 'Happy Birthday' to Himself\n\nTimberlake didn\u2019t just star in the movie The Social Network, he also bought an actual social network, MySpace. The pop star was part of a group of investors who paid $35 million for the now-defunct social media platform in 2011. Although it\u2019s not known how much of that Timberlake himself paid, CEO Tim Vangerhook said at the time that the star was slated to \"lead the business strategy\" for the site, per The Guardian.\"There's a need for a place where fans can go to interact with their favorite entertainers, listen to music, watch videos, share and discover cool stuff and just connect,\u201d Timberlake said in a statement at the time. \u201cMySpace has the potential to be that place.\"\n\nIf you had a feeling Justin Timberlake\u2019s Trolls music sold lots of copies, you\u2019d be right. The song \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling!,\u201d which Timberlake co-wrote, scored him his first Oscar nomination for Best Original Song and sold 2.5 million copies, per Billboard.\n\nAlthough his salary isn\u2019t publicly known, he was also a voice actor in Trolls, later reprising his role as Branch in Trolls Holiday< and Trolls 2: World Tour. The latter movie was released on-demand as well as in theaters, which sources told The Hollywood ReporterTimberlake and his co-star Anna Kendrick weren\u2019t aware would happen. The outlet reported the star\u2019s reps were asking for them to be paid for backend, likely meaning a seven-figure salary.\n\nTimberlake made his romantic comedy debut in Friends with Benefits, starring opposite Mila Kunis. While it\u2019s unclear what he took home for the film, it was a success at the box office, reportedly grossing $55.8 million in the US. It wasn\u2019t Timberlake\u2019s only acting stint, as the star also proved himself a triple threat with roles in films including The Social Network and Bad Teacher.\n\nIn a 2013 Rolling Stone interview, Timberlake said that acting and music are \u201cactually more alike than people would think.\u201d He added, \u201cIn some ways, [acting \u2019s] made me take a slightly different approach to storytelling in some of my songs. I\u2019m gonna put a lot of music out over the course of the year and some songs have become really concept-driven; some songs have become a simple idea that turns into something big.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Timberlake sang the now-iconic \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d jingle for McDonald's. (Is \u201cba da ba ba ba\u201d stuck in your head yet?) The fast-food chain paid him $6 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nPerhaps he later had beef with the burger chain, as he told British GQ in 2007 that he regretted the deal. \"I view the Grammys the same way as I see my deal with McDonald's,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret the McDonald's deal,\" he said, adding, \"It's kind of interesting. Just like the McDonald's deal, whose market share went up 25 percent when I walked into those offices and changed their image. When I did the Grammys, the viewing figures went up by 25 percent. Funny, isn't it?\"\n\nIn 2016, Timberkale was lovin\u2019 a different brand: Bai. He invested in the beverage company that year, although it\u2019s unclear how much he\u2019s made from the investment and partnership. He said in a statement at the time: \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Bai for a long time. This partnership was created from a shared desire to help people put better ingredients in their bodies without sacrificing taste.\u201d He\u2019s also partnered with a range of other brands over the years, including Levi\u2019s and Sony.\n\nNext,\u00a0Justin Timberlake talks the differences\u2014and similarities\u2014between his work in acting and in music.",

The two have a 3-year-old son named Harold.\n\nAlthough this was Gerwig's official announcement breaking the news, she joked to Fallon that \"nobody's paying attention,\" saying, \"I went to an event recently, and I wore something, and I thought everyone would be so interested that I was having another child, and nobody cared.\"\n\nRecently, Gerwig attended various industry events and screenings for her new film, White Noise, picking beautiful outfits to show off her growing baby bump.\n\nOf course, Fallon assured her that \"we are paying attention,\" replying, \"We're so happy for you!\"\n\nFallon then asked what Gerwig's son Harold thinks about the big news, but she wasn't sure.\n\nGerwig said, \"It's hard to know what a 3-year-old makes of things that aren't existent yet in front of him. He's beautifully sophisticated in some ways and then in other ways, he asks, 'What language do they speak in New Jersey?'\"\n\nWhile visiting The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the star also had a chance to talk about two major projects\u2013White Noise, the film Gerwig stars in that came out on Dec. 2, and Barbie, which Gerwig directed and co-wrote with Baumbach. Baumbach also wrote and directed White Noise.\n\nWith so much good news, there's a lot for Gerwig to be excited about in the near future.\n\nWhite Noise, a dramedy also starring Adam Driver about a family ignoring an emerging worldwide disaster, is already in theaters, but everyone will have to wait a little while longer to see the much-anticipated Barbie film.\n\nThe movie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is set to be released on July 21, 2023.",

      "text": "Spy thrillers have a lengthy history in Hollywood, with Netflix\u2019s The Gray Man being the latest to join the movie espionage club, with its titular protagonist joining the long line of super-sleuths such as Jack Bower, Ethan Hunt and James Bond.\n\nBeing \u201cGray\u201d isn\u2019t exactly explained in the movie, it\u2019s simply mentioned as a side comment, so the viewer is free to decipher it however he or she likes. It could be a reference to one\u2019s moral ambiguity, having to do bad things, like killing, for the greater good.\n\nBeing Gray could also easily mean being amorphous and forgettable, not standing out or being as definitive or recognizable as black or white. A handy trait in the world of espionage, to be sure.\n\nIt is in this respect that Ryan Gosling\u2019s character, also known as Sierra-Six, embodies the Gray man persona. Normally the likeable and charming type, Gosling plays Six as passably affable, an everyman that just stays in the background, drawing no more attention to himself than normal, with controlled, cautious movements and a laid back personality.\n\nIn a op (that\u2019s \u201coperation\u201d or mission, for those unfamiliar with spy-thriller jargon) that went south (spiralled out of control) Six finds himself out in the cold on the run. His handler, Ana De Armas\u2019 Agent Dani Miranda is in the wind as well. Nothing new here but a target painted on your back is always a good place to start a film.\n\nRege-Jean Page, of Bridgerton fame, plays Carmichael, a middle-management CIA agent hunting Six down. With him is fellow CIA agent Suzanne Brewer played by Jessica Henswick, who is along for the hunt but disagrees with Carmichael\u2019s methods.\n\nIn what is probably his most fun role, Chris Evans plays completely against type as Lloyd Hansen, a private-sector contract killer called in to help in the smoke out Six. This is as far away from his most recognizable role as Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as he\u2019s gotten since hanging up his shield. Not only is Lloyd a gun for hire, he\u2019s a loud, boisterous, creepily sadistic one at that. Think of his character from Knives Out, but with special forces training and even less of a conscience.\n\nThe Gray Man is an action-thriller traditionally aimed at men, but with heartthrobs like Gosling, Evans and Page, one could say the movie is setting its sights on pulling in the ladies in the audience as well. There is plenty of shooting to go around, as well as explosions and car chases. There are a couple of really large, note-worthy set-pieces, and other little bits of action sprinkled throughout. With a reported budget of US$200 Million, you can tell the Russo Brothers convinced Netflix to spare no expense.\n\nThere are a lot of things happening at once in the film, and the directors and editors do a great job of grabbing you and bringing you along for a wild ride. But perhaps that is also where the film is at its weakest. The Russo brothers just seemed to be dialing things up as the movie goes along, which is great to get the adrenaline pumping, but not so much for story and nuance. Once the action starts, it keeps going, giving the audience hardly enough time to breathe, much less process just why exactly they should be emotionally invested in Sierra-Six.\n\nThe script also seems uneven at times, not giving much development or interest to other characters. Page\u2019s Carmichael is not very threatening, and Fenwick\u2019s constantly contradicting agent Brewer spends ninety percent of the time simply screaming at someone about how badly things have gone.\n\nSix and Lloyd are polar opposites, one being calm and reserved, the other dementedly gregarious and twistedly exuberant. One has somewhat of a working moral compass, and the other threw his out intentionally long ago. It is when these two are at the forefront that the script and dialogue pick up, with plenty of interesting nuances and a bit of injected humor and one-liners. I dare you not to say, \u201cJust another Thursday.\u201d about something after leaving the theater, or to forget Lloyd\u2019s glib, \u201cIf you wanna make an omelette, you gotta kill some people.\u201d\n\nAll in all, the last thing The Gray Man needs to be is gray, and sink into ambiguity. It needs to stand out from the rest, and despite the missteps, it does raise a hand in a crowd and make itself known. It says, \u201cHey! I\u2019m here!

      "text": "Chris Evans\u2019 net worth is practically skyrocketing to infinity and beyond. Whether sporting that iconic\u00a0Knives Out\u00a0sweater\u00a0or suiting up as Captain America, the Lightyear star has earned legions of fans for his many memorable roles. But while the 2022 Sexiest Man Alive\u2014and \u201cbest Chris\u201d contender\u2014has made millions from the latter, multi-film franchise, he initially almost turned down the iconic role.\n\n\u201cI was scared,\u201d he said during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u00a0in 2016, attributing some of his hesitations to the multi-film aspect of the part. \u201cThere are parts of me that have a little bit of social anxiety with this industry. In doing movies one at a time \u2026 you\u2019re afforded the opportunity to take a step back and recalibrate. When you have a giant contract, if all of a sudden you\u2019re not responding well? Too bad, you\u2019ve got to suit up again. That was scary.\u201d\n\nWhile these days the superstar is perhaps best known for the superhero character, he\u2019s also gone on to pursue a range of other roles\u2014including Buzz Lightyear in the animated film Lightyear and a scenery-chewing villain in The Gray Man. Keep reading for everything we know about Chris Evans\u2019 net worth and how he made his fortune.\n\nRelated: Does Chris Evans Have a Girlfriend? Take a Look at the Captain America Star's Dating History\n\nNow a household name, the\u00a0Lightyear star is lightyears away from his first role in a PSA. Evans, whose mother ran a youth theater outside of Boston, got his start in a 1997 project called Biodiversity: Wild About Life!.\u00a0After years of similar small roles, he scored his first major movie role in Not Another Teen Movie.\n\n\u201cI think I wanted to become an actor because I just like movies, whether it was watching something like Kramer vs. Kramer or watching the old Batman movies,\u201d Evans told Parade in 2017 of how he got his start. \u201cWhatever it was, I just think I wanted to be a part of cinema \u2026 I really like films that touch on family dynamics, but again, I like all movies.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Things You Never Knew About Chris Evans\n\nChris Evans\u2019 net worth is estimated at a whopping $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nMarvel\u2019s superhero movies often come with super-sized salaries, and Evans is no exception. He earned $300,000 for Captain America: The First Avenger in 2011, according to The Guardian. His second film in the franchise, Avengers, came with a major pay raise, per Screen Rant, as he reportedly earned $3 million; his pay was then upped to $15 million for Age of Ultron. He ended the franchise on another high note, as Forbes reports he was paid around $15 million for Avengers: Endgame in 2019.\n\nAs for whether he\u2019d reprise the role one more (likely lucrative) time? He told Comicbook.com in June 2022 that he\u2019d only consider it under the right conditions. \u201cThat seems to be something people would like to see,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint anybody but \u2026 it was such a good run and I\u2019m so happy with it. It\u2019s so precious to me. It would have to be perfect. It just would be scary to rattle something that is, again, so, so dear to me. That role means so much to me. So, to revisit it, it would be a tall order.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Watch Every Marvel Movie in Order of Story\n\nIn a word: Marvel! Evans has made a mint starring as Captain America in the MCU, not just for the movies themselves up front (and in back end points!), but also for the use of his likeness in merchandise. He also served as the masculine face of the fragrance Guilty by Gucci\u00a0and appeared in a hilarious Boston-themed Super Bowl ad for Hyundai, each of\u00a0which likely netted him some sweet cash, too.\n\nChris Evans' salary varies depending on what projects he's doing at a given time and in a given year. That said, his salary has risen steadily since taking the role of Captain America: He started with a $300,000 payday for Captain America: The First Avenger and reportedly got $15 million for Avengers: Endgame.\n\nEvans' per-movie salary varies by project. Since becoming an Avenger, however, his price has gone way up and he can command up to $20 million per film, though he often opts for smaller indie projects and fun cameos instead of traditional leading-man blockbuster fare\u2014because now, he can afford to be picky.\n\nRelated: Every Marvel Movie You Can Watch on Disney+\n\nEvans reportedly was paid $15 million for his (ostensibly) final go as Captain America in Avengers: Endgame. That's a pretty sweet exit! If he got box office bonuses, then he really got a good payday, because Avengers: Endgame shattered records and made $2.79 billion.\n\nEvans' salary for Captain America: Civil War was reportedly $15 million. Sometimes it pays to fight your friends.\n\nIt\u2019s not publicly known how much Evans made for his role as Ransom Drysdale in Knives Out. Something he definitely took home, however? \u201cAll of the sweaters\u201d from the set, as he revealed in an interview with People TV. Don\u2019t expect to see him wearing them anytime soon though, as he later told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show that he abandoned the cozy attire after his character\u2019s cable-knit sweater went viral. \u201cI can\u2019t wear them anymore, and it\u2019s a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cI love cable knits, but now, I feel like when I wear them people are like \u2026 I don\u2019t know if it works anymore.\u201d Here\u2019s to hoping Evans\u2019 dog, Dodger, will keep wearing his tiny version of the famed fashion, which he debuted on Twitter following the murder mystery film\u2019s release.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how much Evans made for his brief cameo in Free Guy, hopefully he wasn\u2019t being paid by the minute. Director Shawn Levy told Entertainment Weekly in 2021 that the moment took less than 10 minutes to film, as Evans was busy shooting Apple TV+ series Defending Jacob at the time. \"I recall Chris being like, 'Well, I'm really busy, but if you can get me in and out in like 10 minutes, sure. Why not?'\" he told the outlet, adding that they secretly snuck the star into a restaurant with black coverings on the windows. \u201cChris rolled up, we walked him right into his seat in front of the camera, shot him, hugged it out, and he was on his way in less than 10.\"\n\nEvans was only in Thor: The Dark World quite briefly. As such, his specific salary isn't known, but we can estimate it was at least in the five-figure range.\n\nJust call Evans the king of cameos. His hilarious turn in Spider-Man: Homecoming\u2014as Captain America in a PSA that Tom Holland's Peter Parker was forced to watch in detention\u2014was small, but memorable. That said, his fee for the spot isn't publicly known.\n\nYep, Evans was in a Marvel franchise before the MCU existed! Evans starred as the Human Torch in Fantastic Four and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. His salary for the Fantastic Four franchise isn't publicly known, but was likely substantially lower\u2014at least for the first installment\u2014than his fee for Captain America: The First Avenger, because he was part of an ensemble and not the singular main lead.\n\nPlaying Johnny Storm almost cost him Cap, though!\n\nKevin Feige told The Hollywood Reporter that because Evans already played a superhero, \"We thought, 'OK, well, he\u2019s that character. Let\u2019s keep looking.'\u201d However, they soon changed their minds upon realizing Evans was the best man for the job\u2014and that he wouldn't be the only face of more than one franchise.\n\n\"As we [continued] not finding people, we went back to the initial lists. And that brought us back to Chris,\" Feige recalled. \"And I thought, 'Well, Patrick Stewart played Jean-Luc Picard and Charles Xavier. Harrison Ford played Han Solo and Indiana Jones. Who cares?'\u201d\n\nRelated: From Marvel to Star Wars and Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford's Net Worth Is Hard-Earned\n\nEvans reportedly took home a cool $15 million for Avengers: Infinity War, his penultimate jaunt as Captain America.\n\nIt\u2019s not only movie roles that earn Evans big bucks. Evans reportedly made $750,000 per episode for the Apple TV+ show Defending Jacob. In addition to starring as Andy Barber, he also served as an executive producer for the mystery miniseries. While he told Variety the latter role was \u201creally just title,\u201d he added that it was comforting to feel like \u201cit\u2019s your barbecue too, you\u2019re not just being invited.\u201d\n\nRelated: Keanu Reeves' Net Worth Is as Breathtaking as He Is\n\nReuniting with Knives Out co-star Ana de Armas\u00a0and Captain America: Civil War directors the Russo Brothers, Evans reportedly made big bucks for Netflix's The Gray Man. Evans will reportedly make $15 million for his role in\u00a0the streaming giant's action flick, while other estimates have him and Ryan Gosling at $20 million each.\n\nIt\u2019s not publicly known how much Evans banked for his most recent buzzy role, the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the new Disney-Pixar Toy Story spin-off, which tells the beloved character\u2019s origin story. He previously told Vanity Fair that he used Tim Allen, the original voice of Buzz Lightyear as a \u201cguideline\u201d for his performance. \u201cHe did such a good job, and I\u2019d be a fool not to acknowledge the work he did,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t just do a shameless impression. I had to somehow create my own understanding of the character, and try to make some fresh tracks in the snow while paying homage to the great work that he did. Eventually, I felt comfortable enough to make my own interpretation, and part of that was lowering the tone of my voice. I basically have to lower the register of my voice in everything that I do.\u201d\n\nNext, Chris Evans talks working with children and animals on Gifted and his future as Captain America.",

According to reports, more than 11 million U. S. parents are stay-at-home parents.\n\nRelated: Eva Mendes Goes to Supercuts--So What?\n\n\"Nobody told me it was gonna really be a job,\" she said. \"And a job that I needed an incredible amount of skill for, like in different areas\u2014being a\u00a0chauffeur, a cook, a personal assistant to an abusive boss.\"\n\nMendes cracked that she may not be qualified for her role.\n\n\"In any other profession, you\u2019d need to take a test or pass tests,\" she said. \"The only test I had to pass was a pregnancy test. That doesn\u2019t seem fair, right?\"\n\n\"Nailed it!\" Clarkson, 37, replied, who's a mom to daughter River Rose, 5, and son Remington \"Remy\" Alexander, 3.\n\nFor Mendes, the hardest part is the amount of snacks she has to carry with her all day long, as Clarkson nodded in agreement.\u00a0\"You need to keep it fresh, especially on long car rides,\" Mendes laughed.\n\nThe pair, who have plans for an upcoming playdate when Clarkson finally gets a day off, also touched on their parenting styles.\n\nFor her part, Mendes says she and Gosling, 38, are \"very controlling.\"\n\n\"We're always laughing at these terms, but I think we would be bulldozing parents,\" she said (a bulldozer parent can be described as someone who constantly forces obstacles out of their kids' paths) . \"I heard of the term 'helicopter parent' and I'm like, 'Well, what else are we supposed to do?' They're this big! [showing how tiny they are] We have to be on top of them every second!\"\n\nShe added, \"The stakes are really high so yeah, I'm a helicopter parent. And then I heard the [term] 'bulldozing' and I\u2019m like, 'Ooh, yeah, I\u2019m probably a bulldozing parent too.'\"\n\nFor Mendes, the struggle of motherhood is real, admitting that through the newborn and toddler haze, it's been\u2014well, a haze.\n\n\"I went through a period where this was just no sense of style, or sense of self, really,\" she says. \"I kind of lost myself a little!\"\n\n\"I might be there right now!\" Clarkson laughed.\n\nNext up, read why\u00a0Serena William\u2019s\u00a0husband, Reddit co-founder\u00a0Alexis Ohanian, is\u00a0calling for paid paternity leave\u00a0in the U.

I mean, falling in love with him. Then it made sense for me to have not kids, but his kids. It was very specific to him.\u201d",

      "text": "Before becoming one of Hollywood's most beloved couples, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds started off as \"buddies\"\u2014which isn't all that surprising, considering they're also one of the most down-to-earth twosomes in Tinseltown.\n\n\u201cWe were such good friends for so long and we both got to know each other as friends. It didn\u2019t click for a good year and a half,\" Lively said in a 2016 episode of\u00a0The Jess Cagle Interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what I appreciate about our relationship is that he\u2019s my friend first and foremost.\u201d\n\nReynolds has paid heartwarming tributes to Lively throughout the promo cycle for Spirited, his Christmas musical, including at the 2022 People's Choice Awards.\u00a0Look at how he and his Gossip\u00a0Girl bride went from costars in a superhero movie to real-life power couple who enjoy trolling each other online.\n\nThe pair met in 2010 on the set of their film Green Lantern, which came out the following year. Lively played Carol Ferris, Reynolds' love interest, in the movie, while Reynolds took on the title role.\n\nRelated: 5 Things You Didn't Know About Ryan Reynolds\n\nThe now-46-year-old Reynolds and 35-year-old Lively were first linked in 2011. That October, a source told PEOPLE, \u201cThey are very much a couple.\"\n\nReynolds admitted that fireworks erupted between him and Lively while they were out on a double date ... but not with each other!\n\n\u201cAbout a year after\u00a0Green Lantern had come and gone and we were both single, we went on a double date\u2014she was on a date with another guy and I was on a date with another girl \u2013 and it was like the most awkward date for the respective parties because we were just like fireworks coming across,\u201d he recalled on SiriusXM\u2019s Entertainment Weekly Radio in 2016. \"We were buddies for a long time, which I think is the best way to have a relationship, to start as friends.\"\n\nLively admittedly wanted to marry her former costar because she knew he would always be her \"best friend\" for her \"whole life.\"\n\n\"That was the biggest thing to me,\" she explained to Marie Claire in 2016. \"I'd never known anything like the friendship that I had with him. I could like him as much as I loved him.\"\n\nLively, wearing a silk tulle gown by Marchesa, secretly married Reynolds in 2012 at the Boone Hall Plantation in South Carolina. \"When they decided to marry, they wanted to celebrate in privacy\u2014and in style,\" Martha Stewart Weddings noted of the couple's nuptials. Florence Welch performed at the reception, during which Lively's dress got burnt by a sparkler. \"Right on the front! And it was just so heartbreaking to me,\" Lively later revealed in an interview with Vogue. \"And later, my dress was hanging up and Ryan said, \u2018Isn\u2019t that beautiful?\u2019 I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he pointed to the burn. My heart just stopped, because it was such a sensitive little subject. And he said, \u2018You\u2019ll always remember that moment with Florence singing and the sparklers. You have that forever, right there, preserved.\u2019 Now that\u2019s my favorite part of the dress.\"\n\nIn 2020, the Deadpool actor called his and Lively's decision to host their wedding at the plantation, which\u00a0features nine slave cabins, a \"giant mistake.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ll always be deeply and unreservedly sorry for,\u201d Reynolds said in an interview with Fast Company. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to reconcile. What we saw at the time was a wedding venue on Pinterest. What we saw after was a place built upon devastating tragedy. Years ago we got married again at home\u2014but shame works in weird ways. A giant f-cking mistake like that can either cause you to shut down or it can reframe things and move you into action. It doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t f-ck up again. But re-patterning and challenging lifelong social conditioning is a job that doesn\u2019t end.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ryan Reynolds Reveals the Best Advice He'd Give His Younger Self\n\nThe Hollywood stars are parents to three daughters. Lively and Reynolds welcomed their first child,\u00a0James, in 2014, followed by Inez in 2016 and Betty in 2019. They are currently expecting their fourth child.\n\nDespite being in the spotlight, the actors are keen on giving their children a normal life\u2014which reportedly includes raising them in New York's Westchester County, about two hours north of New York City. \"Ryan had a nice, normal upbringing, and we want our kids to have the same normal life that we had,\" Lively previously explained to Marie\u00a0Claire. \"We don't ever want to rob them of what we had because we'd feel really selfish.\"\n\nRelated: Blake Lively On How Her Marriage To Ryan Reynolds Influenced Her Work\n\nThe actor was previously married to Scarlett\u00a0Johansson. The Black Widow star and Reynolds wed in September 2008, but announced in December 2010 that they were splitting.\n\n\u201cAfter long and careful consideration on both our parts, we\u2019ve decided to end our marriage,\u201d they said in a joint statement (via PEOPLE). \u201cWe entered our relationship with love and it\u2019s with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isn\u2019t expected, it\u2019s certainly appreciated.\u201d\n\nPrior to Johansson, Reynolds was engaged to Grammy-winning singer Alanis Morissette. According to PEOPLE, the former couple met in 2002 at Drew Barrymore\u2019s birthday party and dated for two years before they got engaged in 2004. However, the Canadian-born stars never made it down the aisle, calling off their engagement in 2007. In a joint statement (via PEOPLE), their reps said, \"They remain close friends and continue to have the utmost love and admiration for each other.\"\n\nMorissette's song \"Torch\" is believed to be about Reynolds.\n\nReynolds reportedly enjoyed a summer fling with actress Charlize Theron in 2011. Explaining why they split, a source told\u00a0Us Weekly, \"He only wanted something casual, but she's in a rush to settle down, have kids and start a family since she's getting older.\"\n\nFollowing his divorce from Johansson, it was reported in March 2011 that The\u00a0Proposal\u00a0actor was\u00a0dating German model Agnes Fischer.\n\nPer PEOPLE, Reynolds and She's All That star\u00a0Rachael Leigh Cook were together\u00a0throughout the early 2000s.\n\nThe 3rd Rock from the Sun actress briefly dated Reynolds in 1999, according to PEOPLE. Johnston spoke about her ex during a 2020 appearance on Watch What Happens Live. \"It was so long ago I forgot, but literally, so nice, great guy, lovely,\" she said of Reynolds. \"Lovely person.\"\n\nRyan had an eight-month relationship with his Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place co-star\u00a0in 1998, per PopSugar.\n\nThe Sabrina the Teenage Witch\u00a0TV movie costars were \"smitten\" with each other, Melissa Joan Hart admitted on Australia\u2019s\u00a0Studio 10\u00a0in 2017. The actress, who had a boyfriend at the time, received a watch from Reynolds on the last day of shooting the 1996 flick.\u00a0Hart told E! News' Giuliana Rancic in 2014,\u00a0\"I chased him down, got in front of his car and just kissed him and then made out with him all night,\" adding, \"Then I had to call my boyfriend the next day and explain it.\" Hart also revealed that Reynolds came to visit her in New York. She said,\u00a0\"But I think he wanted something more but I decided I was going to stick with my boyfriend.\"\n\nSoon before she got together with Reynolds, Lively was linked to one of the world's most famous actors: Leonardo DiCaprio. The two enjoyed a summer fling while gallivanting around Europe, but by September 2011, it was over and Lively was ready to meet her Mr. Right.\n\nBefore settling down, Lively reportedly had another brief affair with another famous Hollywood Ryan (that would be Ryan Gosling) in 2010. Although the romance was never officially confirmed, they were caught canoodling at the afterparty for his 2010 romantic drama Blue\u00a0Valentine and spotted together on a date at Disneyland. In December 2010, a source told E! News, \"They've been out a few times and are definitely into each other, but I don't think it's super\u00a0serious or anything right now... They're casually dating, but I could see it becoming more.\" Spoiler alert: It didn't become something more, and the two fizzled out after a few months. (Gosling, of course, is now with Eva\u00a0Mendes.)\n\nRelated: All About Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes' Relationship\n\nBefore Reynolds came along, Lively's most serious romance was arguably the one she enjoyed with her Gossip Girl co-star, Penn\u00a0Badgley. The two were together from 2007 to 2010, but kept their relationship tightly under wraps\u2014because, as Lively recalled to Vanity\u00a0Fair in 2017, \"We were just afraid of how our personal lives overlapping our work life could be perceived by our bosses.\" When they split, Lively and Badgeley (who's now married to Domino\u00a0Kirke) hid their breakup from their coworkers as well.\n\n\u201cThe shocking thing was, I found out on the set of the Season 2 finale that Blake and Penn had broken up months before,\u201d GossipGirl writer and co-producer Joshua\u00a0Safran told Vanity Fair. \u201cThey kept the breakup hidden from the crew, which you could never do now. I don\u2019t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.\u201d\n\nNext, some of our favorite Ryan Reynolds quotes!",

      "text": "Titanic director James Cameron has revealed that actor Leonardo DiCaprio almost missed out on one of his most well-known roles for being \u201ctoo negative\u201d.\n\nAccording to the director, DiCaprio did not want to read lines with potential co-star Kate Winslet in a screen test.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: James Cameron reveals Leonardo DiCaprio was \u2018so negative e\u2019.\n\nFor more Celebrity Gossip related news and videos check out Celebrity Gossip >>\n\n\u201cThere was a meeting with Leo and then there was a screen test with Leo,\u201d Cameron told GQ.\n\n\u201cThe meeting was funny because I am sitting in my conference room, waiting to meet an actor\u2026 I look around, and all the women in the entire office are in the meeting\u2026\n\n\u201cThey all wanted to meet Leo. It was hysterical.\u201d\n\nCameron said the young actor \u201ccharmed everybody\u201d and made an impression with his acting chops, leading to a callback.\n\n\u201cHe came back a couple of days later, and I had the camera set up to record the video,\u201d the director continued.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know he was going to test. He thought it was another meeting to meet Kate.\n\n\u201cSo I said, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll just go in the next room, and we\u2019ll run some lines, and I\u2019ll video it.\u2019 And he said, \u2018You mean, I\u2019m reading?\u2019\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 He said, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t read.\u2019\n\n\u201cI shook his hand and said, \u2018Thanks for coming by\u2019.\u201d\n\nSurprised by Cameron\u2019s directness, DiCaprio supposedly said, \u201cWait, wait, wait. If I don\u2019t read, I don\u2019t get the part? Just like that?\u201d\n\nDiCaprio changed his mind, agreeing to do the screen test, but reportedly complained all the way up to when the scene began.\n\n\u201cHe comes in, and he\u2019s like every ounce of his entire being is just so negative \u2026 right up until I said, \u2018Action\u2019,\u201d Cameron recalled.\n\n\u201cKate just lit up, and they played the scene. Dark clouds had opened up, and a ray of sun came down and lit up Jack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018All right. He\u2019s the guy\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe role of Jack Dawson went on to become one of DiCaprio\u2019s most well-known and led to Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award wins.\n\nTitanic won 11 of the 14 Academy Award nominations it received including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cinematography.\n\nFor more engaging entertainment content, visit 7Life on Facebook.",

      "text": "Britney Spears has been working since childhood. After years of dance lessons (which began when she was a toddler) and voice lessons, plus appearing in pageants and working the talent-show circuit, the future pop icon made her showbiz debut when she appeared on Star Search\u00a0at the tender age of 10.\n\nFrom there, she became a fixture on Disney's Mickey Mouse Club alongside fellow future stars Christina Aguilera, Ryan Gosling and her first highly publicized love, Justin Timberlake. But it was in January 1999, when Spears dropped her first album, ...Baby One More Time, that she rocketed to instant superstardom\u2014and started raking in the big bucks. The LP debuted at No. 1, largely thanks to its titular lead single and its iconic, schoolgirl-themed music video. It was official: Spears was on top of the world.\n\nEver since, the 39-year-old has had a rollercoaster of a life in the spotlight: Becoming one of the most famous women on the planet at just 16 years old, Spears' personal and professional ups and downs have been the stuff of tabloid fodder for more than two decades and counting. Her net worth is an undeniably hefty sum, but after a conservatorship was put in place following her mental health struggles in 2008, Spears was not permitted to spend her hard-earned money as she chose to; she also wasn't free to make a shocking array of decisions for herself, according to testimony she'd given in court.\n\nThen in November 2021, Spears stopped being so \"Overprotected\" when a California judge ruled that the conservatorship should be terminated. As Judge Brenda Penny declared in court,\u00a0\u201cThe conservatorship of the person and estate of Britney Jean Spears is no longer required.\"\n\nWith so much on the line for the beloved singer, here's what we know about Britney Spears' net worth, how she built her fortune and what living under a conservatorship cost her\u2014financially as well as emotionally.\n\nRelated: Freed Britney! Britney Spears' Conservatorship Has Finally Come to an End\u2014Find Out All the Latest\n\nSpears' net worth is estimated to be about $60 million, per Forbes. Most of her assets (over $56 million) are reportedly in the forms of investments and real estate, with just under $3 million in cash.\n\nTo the rest of us, $60 million may be a mind-boggling figure\u2014but it's actually surprisingly small for a megastar of Spears' stature. As Forbes has pointed out, Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Lopez, as just two examples, have had careers that mimicked Spears' in many ways, yet both of those women are sitting on fortunes of more than $100 million.\n\nSo what happened? Forbes has hinted that dad Jamie didn't do a good job of managing her money; the fact that Britney doesn't work as much as she used to, of course, doesn't help. The outlet notes that she \"stopped doing television commercials in 2015. Spears hasn\u2019t released new music since 2016 and she stopped touring in 2018.\"\n\nAccording to The New YorkTimes, as of 2021, Jamie Spears was receiving a salary of \u201cabout $16,000 per month, plus $2,000 a month for office space rent\u201d to act as Britney\u2019s conservator. It\u2019s also been reported that Jamie received a percentage of the profits from Britney\u2019s tours and other endeavors. As just one example from the Times\u2018 reporting: \u201cIn 2014, he was granted 1.5 percent of gross revenues from the performances and merchandising tied to her Las Vegas residency, \u2018Piece of Me,\u2019 which went on to earn\u00a0a reported $138 million across nearly 250 shows.\u201d That stipulation alone would've presumably brought Jamie more than $2 million in income.\n\nIn August 2021, Jamie made a shocking decision to step down as one of Britney's financial conservators, which would likely mean that he wouldn't be able to count on any income from his pop-icon daughter anymore. However, some #FreeBritney observers believed that Jamie would likely try to negotiate a payout for himself, as well as some legal protection (Britney has threatened to sue him and have him charged with \"conservatorship abuse\") before he'd agree to officially walk away\u2014and in fact, his lawyers said basically the same thing in a statement to Yahoo! News.\n\n\"Jamie Spears is not stepping down unless the court approves payment of the attorney's fees that he's seeking of $1.2 million dollars\u00a0and his compensation,\" attorney Christopher C. Melcher told the outlet. \"So he's conditioned his exit on the court approving things that Britney has previously objected to.\"\n\nWhile it's not entirely clear which of Jamie's conditions were accepted by his daughter's legal team, the following month, his role as a co-conservator was officially ended.\n\nObviously, a large amount of Spears' net worth is from her music career: Billboard estimated in 2017 that Spears has sold upwards of 150 million albums worldwide. She reportedly earned album advances as high as $10 million apiece during the heyday of her recording career.\n\nRelated:\u00a0Britney Spears Just Recreated Her \u201cBaby One More Time\u201d Look, and We Feel Complete\n\nIn addition to album sales, Spears has gone on 10 tours since 1999, most of which had almost entirely sold-out dates. Throughout her career, Spears' tours have grossed between $300,000 to over $4 million per show.\n\nSince 2000, Spears has negotiated an enormous number of endorsement deals. One of her most lucrative partnerships was signed in 2001, when she agreed to rep Pepsi for what was estimated to be $8 million. (Funny enough, it was reported about a dozen years later that Spears' investment portfolio included stock in Pepsi's rival, Coca-Cola!) In 2011, one of Spears' most controversial endorsement deals came to fruition when she was reportedly paid $500,00 for a series of product placements\u2014including PlentyOfFish, Makeup For Ever and Sony\u2014in her \"Hold It Against Me\" music video. That move was apparently panned by fellow pop A-lister Katy Perry, who seemed to call out Spears when she tweeted around that time, \"You have to get creative with [product placement in videos]. Some artists don't care, though, and you can tell.\"\n\nThose aren't the only brands Spears has worked for as a spokesperson. She's also repped a slew of well-known products, including:\n\nWhile many celebrities fail at fragrance lines, Spears made a $1 billion empire with hers. Released through Elizabeth Arden, Spears' first fragrance, Curious, shattered the company's sales records when it debuted in 2004, followed by Fantasy in 2005. Since then, she's released more than 28 scents through her brand.\n\nSpears spent one season as a judge on FOX's TheX Factor\u00a0and raked in a cool $15 million.\n\nSpears performed her first Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, from December 2013 to December 2017, grossing $137.6 million with 916,184 tickets sold for 248 shows.\n\nThe \"Toxic\" singer was slated to kick off another residency, called\u00a0Britney: Domination, in 2019, but it was canceled amid dad Jamie's physical health struggles and the toll it took on her own mental wellbeing. She reportedly would have had a $500,000 guarantee per show for her Domination residency had it taken place as scheduled.\n\nSpears is no stranger to buying and selling properties.\n\nIn 2001, Spears purchased a Hollywood Hills mansion for $2.9 million, selling it to the late Brittany Murphy\u00a0for $3.8 million two years later.\n\nIn 2002, Spears bought a New York City penthouse previously owned by Keith Richards, selling it for $4 million in 2004. The same year, she purchased a home in Malibu with ex Federline for $13.5 million, later selling the property and breaking even when they divorced in 2006. She purchased a mansion in Beverly Hills in 2007 for $6.8 million, then another in Calabasas, California, in 2008, which she sold in 2011 for $4.49 million (after plunking down a cool $700,000 worth of renovations first).\n\nBy 2012, Spears and her sons resided in a Thousand Oaks, California home, which she listed for $9 million in 2016. She purchased a different home in the same neighborhood in 2015 for $7.4 million.\n\nIn July 2020, Spears listed her former Beverly Hills mansion for $6.8 million.\n\nIn January 2019, Spears announced that she was on an \"indefinite work hiatus,\" citing her father's ill health. Her manager, LarryRudolph, told Billboardin May 2019 that he wasn't sure if she'd ever work again\u2014but clarified that fans shouldn't necessarily fret.\n\n\"I simply said that the Vegas residency is now officially off and that she hasn\u2019t called me in months to talk about doing anything so I\u2019m not sure if or when she will ever want to work again. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d he said. \u201cI have one role in Britney\u2018s life. I\u2019m her manager. She calls me if and when she wants to work. Other than that, I\u2019m not involved in anything else. Not the conservatorship, not her medical treatment, not her kids. Nothing else.\u201d\n\nSpears, like the rest of us, has a Target obsession. According to conservatorship documents obtained by\u00a0Entertainment Tonight, Spears made 80 trips to the big box retailer in 2018. She reportedly spent $66,000 on household supplies from stores including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon\u00a0and 7-Eleven. The singer also plunked down $70,000 on travel in 2018, including $16,000 for four nights at the Montage Beverly Hills hotel.\n\nHowever, in court testimony surrounding her conservatorship, Spears and her team have alleged that she's actually kept on a strict financial leash. She's even claimed that she's been forbidden from painting her own kitchen cabinets because the project would cost too much.\n\nSpears also pays child support to ex-husband Kevin Federline for their two sons, Sean Preston Federline and Jayden James Federline. Spears was paying Federline $20,000 per month, plus about $15,000 in monthly expenses, for the boys until late 2018, when their arrangement changed and Federline received \"thousands more\" per month, though exact figures were not revealed.\n\nNext, find out who the richest Kardashian is.",

Try Neon's jaw-dropping concert-nightmare doco\n\n* Nope, Bullet Train and Disney+'s Prey among August's must see movies\n\n* Project X: A truly awful 'comedy' inspired by an infamous party hits Netflix\n\n* Disney's She-Hulk, Neon's House of the Dragon, Netflix's Sandman among August's must see TV\n\nThe Big Short tells the story of how a group of investors discovered how flawed and corrupt America\u2019s mortgage market is, while researching how best to bet against it.\n\nAdam McKay does a magnificent job of turning Michael Lewis\u2019 2010 book on how the financial crisis of 2007-08 was triggered by the US housing bubble into a hilarious, compelling, entertaining and rage-inducing black comedy.\n\nA star-studded cast, including Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt and Succession\u2019s Jeremy Strong, sell the story of how a group of investors discovered how flawed and corrupt America\u2019s mortgage market is, while researching how best to bet against it.\n\nHowever, the real scene-stealers are the likes of Selena Gomez, Anthony Bourdain and Margot Robbie, who break the fourth wall to explain tricky financial concepts such as sub-prime mortgages and synthetic collateralised debt obligations.\n\nThe seemingly unlikely pairing of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels turned out to be comedic gold, with this sometimes anarchic comedy raking in around 14-times its US$17m budget at box-offices worldwide.\n\nThe duo play limo driver Lloyd Christmas and his best mate Harry Dunne, two dunderheads who set on a cross-country road trip to reunite a briefcase with its owner.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this fantasy of anti-social behaviour so painfully funny, is the gulf between etiquette and vulgarity, the desire to be a child whooping it up in the adult world,\u201d wrote The Independent on Sunday\u2019s Ryan Gilbey.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz teamed up for Gangs of New York.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese uses his camera and lighting magnificently to recreate an environment where life was nasty, brutish and short. Jay Cocks, Kenneth Lonergan and Steven Zaillian's script also has a grand feel, mixing in notions of xenophobia and electoral tampering, which are still extremely relevant in 21st-century America, into what is essentially a story of revenge.\n\nWhile Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, John C. Reilly and Jim Broadbent are all solid, if unspectacular, in their key roles, it is Daniel Day Day-Lewis who steals the show. Returning from a five-year hiatus, Day-Lewis, sporting outrageous facial fungus, a Dr Seuss hat, a glass eye and a proto-New York accent, demonstrates what the world had been missing out on during his cobbling sabbatical, as well as now that he has \u201cretired\u201d.\n\nKevin Costner\u2019s other post-apocalyptic movie of the \u201990s had an even worse reception than the much-maligned Waterworld.\n\nThree-hours long, this 2013-set tale of a nomadic drifter who inspires hope in a neo-Western dystopia after he comes across an old US Post Service mail carrier\u2019s uniform, only managed to make back one-quarter of its US$80m budget.\n\nAn adaptation of David Brin\u2019s 1985 book of the same name, The Postman also made a clean sweep of the five Golden Raspberry Awards it was nominated for. A movie so bad, it just has to be seen to be believed.\n\nChristian Bale plays one of two rival magicians in The Prestige.\n\nAlthough overshadowed by his more celebrated projects, this dark, dense and devilishly clever drama from Christopher Nolan is a reminder of the potent power of a little showmanship and superior storytelling.\n\nThe superb cast includes Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie. A film that deserves and rewards close and repeat inspection.\n\nStarring Keanu Reeves, The Replacements is a sports comedy loosely based on the 1987 NFL Strike.\n\nKeanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Rhys Ifans and Jon Favreau team up for this sport comedy loosely based on the 1987 NFL Strike. That\u2019s when the then Washington Redskins won three games without the regular players and went on to take out Super Bowl XXII.\n\n\u201cIt's just plain good fun, good solid dialogue peppered with plenty of grins, and a lot of football action,\u201d wrote Hollywood Report Card\u2019s Ross Anthony, while Detroit Free Press\u2019 Terry Lawson issued a challenge: \u201cI dare you not to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nTommy Lee Jones reprised his popular character from The Fugitive \u2013 Samuel Gerard \u2013 in U. S. Marshals.\n\nFive years after chasing Harrison Ford\u2019s Dr Richard Kimble in The Fugitive, Tommy Lee Jones\u2019 Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard was back on the hunt \u2013 this time trailing Mark Sheridan (Wesley Snipes), a federal prisoner accused of double murder.\n\nHowever, as he\u2019s joined in the pursuit by State Department agent John Royce (Robert Downey Jr.), Gerard begins to wonder if Sheridan really is the killer authorities claim.\n\n\u201cHis ability to effortlessly convey masculine strength, humour, complexity, and a just-palpable dark side makes his mere presence in a movie sufficient reason to watch it,\u201d Austin Chronicle\u2019s Russell Smith wrote of Jones\u2019 performance.",

      "text": "The greatest movie musicals of all time (and where you can watch them)\n\nEver since Al Jolson enthused that \"you ain't heard nuthin' yet\" in 1927's The Jazz Singer, the musical has been a staple of cinema.\n\nFrom Singing in the Rain to last year\u2019s star-studded The Prom, movies and music have often been a marriage made in heaven. Yes, there have been some missteps and high-profile misfires along the way (think the 1980 Neil Diamond-starring remake of The Jazz Singer or 2019\u2019s much-reviled Cats), but there are many examples that show just what a transformative and emotional experience the movie-musical can be.\n\nIn the hope of putting an extra spring in your step and a little more light in your life during lockdown, Stuff to Watch has come up with this list of what we consider to be the greatest flicks-with-tunes of all time (and where you can watch them).\n\nMoulin Rouge!, Beauty and the Beast and West Side Story are amongst the best-ever movie musicals now available to stream in New Zealand.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Eight great movies that are now 40 years old (and where you can watch them)\n\n* Oscar-nominated Pinocchio among eight great films at this year's Cinema Italiano\n\n* Crazy Celine Dion-inspired 'biopic' headlines French Film Festival Aotearoa 2021\n\nWhile Beauty and the Beast lacks a standout pop hit, it does boast a clutch of fantastic songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.\n\nIt's hard to believe now, but once upon a time animated films came without celebrity voices and songwriting, weren't littered with pop-culture references and were hand-drawn, rather than computer designed. And, in this 1991 case, it was nominated for Oscar\u2019s Best Picture (beaten by The Silence of the Lambs), but did get the consolation of winning the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Musical or Comedy).\n\nWhile this 18th Century fairytale-inspired story lacks a standout pop hit, it does boast a clutch of fantastic songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Incredibly the work of 12 writers, the story mixes visual and verbal humour (\"If It Ain't Baroque, don't fix it\") with some genuine scares that hark back to Disney's golden era of Pinocchio and Snow White.\n\nRenee Zellweger plays Roxie Hart in the 2002 adaptation of Chicago.\n\nThis Oscar-winning, 2002 movie was based on the 1970s' Bob Fosse and Fred Ebb musical, which was itself taken from the 1926 Maurine Dallas Watkins play. Inspired by Watkins' time as a Chicago Tribune reporter during the \"trial of the century\" of accused murderess Roxie Hart, Rob Marshall\u2019s daring and inventive showstopper is the tale of two women \u2013 Roxie (Renee Zellweger) and Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones).\n\nWhile embracing Chicago's theatrical roots through elaborate set-pieces, stunning footwork, brassy singing and glittering costumes, Marshall also created something distinctly cinematic.\n\nAmy Adams and Patrick Dempsey teamed up for Enchanted.\n\nRight from the pop-up storybook opening with narration by Julie Andrews, Kevin Lima\u2019s 2007 fantasy is both a beautiful homage to (listen out for cameos from previous Disney heroines) and witty subversion of Disney's animated legacy.\n\nAmy Adams is magnificent as Giselle, the Princess tricked by a jealous Queen into ending up in a place where there are apparently no happy afters \u2013 modern-day New York. Patrick Dempsey is the divorce lawyer and father-of-one who changes her fairytale views.\n\nDismissed by some critics for its hokey storytelling and mixed performances from its leads, this 2017 was willed to box office success by audiences who returned again and again to revel in Hugh Jackman\u2019s performance as P. T. Barnum.\n\nJoined by the likes of Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and the half-Kiwi Keala Settle, Michael Gracey\u2019s tale of the rise and fall of Barnum\u2019s American Museum and its human \u201cattractions\u201d is swept along by poignant and powerful songs like A Million Dreams, Never Enough and the anthemic This is Me.\n\nThere's a reason Hamilton is one of the most popular stage shows in the world.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s actually just a filmed version of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s smash hit Broadway show (a proper cinematic adaptation is still planned down the track), this 2020 release just reminds you of the power of a stage production and the breathtaking audaciousness of Miranda\u2019s vision.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s the incredible life and times of one of America\u2019s Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton, told through an eclectic range of musical styles \u2013 from hip hop to rap.\n\nThis thoroughly modern 2016 update of the traditional old school Hollywood musical initially appears to display the worst excesses of America's sung story tradition. But then, gradually, Damien Chazelle gets its hooks (and harmonies) into you and, by the end, you\u2019ll be entranced by its love letter to Los Angeles, bittersweet romance and songs that will still be stuck in your head a week after viewing.\n\nIt also helps that it boasts two extremely appealing leads. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both enhanced their individual reputations and their stock as Hollywood's best cinematic pairing since Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.\n\nHugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were among the star-studded cast for the 2012 adaptation of Les Miserables.\n\nTom Hooper\u2019s 2012 version of Alain Boublil, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Herbert Kretzmer's adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1862 post-French revolution novel is better than anyone dared to dream. Natural lighting, hand-held camerawork and non-perfect singing give the film the grim, grimy realism that this sweeping, Dickensian-esque story deserves.\n\nDelivering a powerhouse, and refreshingly \"ugly\" performance, Hugh Jackman is a stunning Jean Valjean, while Eddie Redmayne is a revelation and a distressed and de-tressed Anne Hathaway steals the show as Fantine with her heartbreaking rendition of I Dreamed A Dream.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors\u2019 \u201cmean green mutha\u201d goes in for the kill.\n\nFormer Muppet man Frank Oz is the perfect director for this 1986 adaptation of the 1960s-set black comedy (itself inspired by a 1960 Roger Corman movie), first performed off-Broadway in 1982. Not only does he bring the central \u201cmonster plant\u201d to magnificent life via animatronics and the dulcet tones of Levi Stubbs, but he also manages to make the audience believe in Ghostbusters\u2019 Rick Moranis as a romantic lead.\n\nAside from scene-stealing cameos from the likes of John Candy, Bill Murray and Steve Martin, the real stars are Alan Menken and Howard Ashman\u2019s toe-tapping tunes and hilarious lyrics.\n\nNicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor teamed up for Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge!\n\nThe ultimate jukebox musical for Generation Xers and the 2001 high point of Australian director Baz Luhrmann\u2019s visual symphonic style. Ewan McGregor is the struggling writer who falls for the eponymous cabaret\u2019s star courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), an infatuation that he\u2019s warned will only end badly.\n\nAn eclectic supporting cast, that includes John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh, sing and dance their way through mash-ups and reimaginings of 1970s and \u201880s hits like Roxanne, Your Song, Lady Marmalade and Like A Virgin, whose lyrics take on new, evocative and provocative meanings. A visual and aural triumph that, once witnessed, is not easily forgotten.\n\nOnce made stars out of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.\n\nCharming 2007 romantic-musical that has since gone on to become a popular stage show. Writer-director John Carney\u2019s masterstroke was casting two professional musicians, rather than actors, to play Dublin\u2019s Grafton Street busker (Glen Hansard) and Czech flower seller (Marketa Irglova).\n\nThe pair\u2019s chemistry is palpable from the off, their singing voices magnificent and the eventual outcome not what you might expect. It\u2019s hard not to shed a tear, or have chills down your spine, when they combine to sing the Oscar-winning tune Falling Slowly.\n\nThe Sound of Music: Now an unlikely staple of Christmas television viewing.\n\nMore than 55 years after its 1965 debut, Robert Wise\u2019s adaptation of Rogers and Hammerstein\u2019s musical is still entertaining audiences, most notably as a staple of Christmas viewing.\n\nBased on Maria von Trapp\u2019s 1949 memoir, it\u2019s an unlikely premise for a beloved family film. A young governess takes charge of a retired naval officer and widower\u2019s seven children, charms them all and then must help them escape the invading Nazis. A Technicolour marvel, Wise found inventive ways to add visual spice to the clutch of memorable songs, especially the title tune.\n\nCurrently being remade by Steven Spielberg, the 1961 original\u2019s success will take a lot of beating. Not only did it take home 10 Oscars (including Best Picture), but it was also the highest-grossing film of that year.\n\nAn adaptation of the 1957 Broadway hit, this Romeo and Juliet-esque tale focuses on Natalie Wood\u2019s Maria and Richard Beymer\u2019s Tony, star-crossed lovers because their families are part of rival gangs. Magnificently choreographed and filled with beautiful songs like Tonight and Somewhere, it\u2019s a rare case of two directors being better than one. Robert Wise looked after the dramatics, while Jerome Robbins (who had helped bring the Broadway show to life) was in charge of the musical sequences.\n\nThe original version of this article first appeared in June.",

      "text": "And the best bargain is getting something for free. Even better \u2014 it\u2019s ad-free.\n\nKanopy started operating in Australia 18 months ago but lacks the marketing power of its bigger-name counterparts such as Netflix or Disney+ so it doesn\u2019t have a high profile among the streaming masses.\n\nBut it has a catalogue of great movies that more than rivals Netflix or Stan \u2013 in fact, you\u2019ll often find some titles are only available on Kanopy.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only free streaming platform but its advantage over SBS On Demand is that it\u2019s ad-free, and it\u2019s way better than Tubi in that it\u2019s not populated by unwatchable B-movies that are more akin to porn knock-offs but without the porn.\n\nHOW TO JOIN NOW\n\nMembership to Kanopy is tied to, all of things, your library card.\n\nThat\u2019s right, you need to join your local council library or university library to access Kanopy. Not all councils are signed up to Kanopy but you can check if yours is here.\n\nYou know how your library had that small selection of VHS (and then-DVD) tapes that you could borrow? This is the 21st century version of that, and there are no waiting lists for Fern Gully to be brought back.\n\nOnce you have your library card number and password in hand, you can sign up for a Kanopy account and off you go.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nParticipating libraries pay Kanopy a licence fee for access to its platform but there\u2019s no cost to you (other than through your council rates).\n\nMost libraries will set a monthly limit to how many movies you can stream.\n\nFor example, the City of Sydney council has a limit of five movies (or credits) per member. When you start playing a movie, you have three days to finish it, after that, if you play that film again, it\u2019ll use up another credit. Once you use up your monthly credits, you\u2019ll have to wait until the next calendar month. Unused credits don\u2019t roll over and you can\u2019t purchase any additional credits.\n\nBut there is a loophole \u2013 if you\u2019re a member of two different participating libraries, such as the University of Melbourne and City of Melbourne, then you\u2019re allowed to use credits allocated by both libraries. Children\u2019s and educational content has no limits.\n\nLike Netflix and other streaming apps, Kanopy is compatible on desktop browsers, mobile phones, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, selected Android and Samsung smart TVs, Telstra TV and Chromecast.\n\nThere is another catch. Sometimes \u2013 usually towards the end of the month \u2013 you may see a message that says access is limited by your library and you can\u2019t watch anything. That means your library has probably exceeded its budget (libraries pay for each title that is watched) and you\u2019ll have to wait for the next calendar month when it resets, even if you have unused credits.\n\nRELATED: The movies to look forward to in 2020\n\nWHAT YOU CAN WATCH NOW\n\nKanopy has an impressive and curated library of films, focusing on acclaimed independent movies, foreign language movies or hidden gems. In other words, you won\u2019t find any mindless Michael Bay blockbusters here, but you might find your new favourite.\n\nNew titles are frequently being added but here are some of the best films on Kanopy right now.\n\nGood Time: Before you plunge into the mad world of Uncut Gems, check out the Safdie brothers\u2019 previous flick. It stars Robert Pattinson as Connie, a bank robber whose brother gets nabbed after a dye pack explodes during a job. In order to secure the bail money, Connie will do anything.\n\nLady Macbeth: Florence Pugh is the hottest star in movies right now, so make sure you\u2019ve seen her breakout performance in the hauntingly confronting Lady Macbeth where she plays a young woman married off to a cold and uninterested older man in a deal for worthless land.\n\nColossal: A genre-defying black dramedy with a clever twist, Anne Hathaway plays a screw-up alcoholic with a bizarre connection to a Godzilla-like monster on the other side of the world.\n\nBoy: Taika Waititi\u2019s tender and droll Kiwi movie is centred on 11-year-old Boy, obsessed with Michael Jackson, living with his grandmother and trying to impress a girl at school. When his father returns looking for his lost money, Boy is desperate to have a relationship with his old-man. It has Waititi\u2019s signature blend of humour and heart.\n\nOnly Lovers Left Alive: One of seven Jim Jarmusch films on Kanopy (the others include Paterson and Mystery Train), this hypnotic and languid story about two centuries-old vampires stars Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston.\n\nBrooklyn: A sweeping historical story, Brooklyn stars Saoirse Ronan as a young Irish woman who arrives in New York City in the 1950s and finds herself torn between the pull of Ireland with the possibilities of her new home.\n\nMeek\u2019s Cutoff: Set in the mid-19th century, this smart western from director and indie darling Kelly Reichardt follows a group of settlers whose two-week journey west turns into an unexpected ordeal of survival.\n\nBlue Valentine: Derek Cianfrance\u2019s drama features Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling as a young couple whose marriage is on the brink, with the film oscillating between when they first fell in love and how it all falls apart.\n\nAnimal Kingdom: The Australian thriller from director David Michod follows a merciless Melbourne crime family and launched the international careers of Jacki Weaver, Ben Mendelsohn and Joel Edgerton.\n\nAmour: The multi-award winning French film by renowned filmmaker Michael Haneke is a beautiful treatise on love, ageing and grief. Emmanuelle Riva became the oldest Oscar Best Actress nominee for her role in Amour.\n\nThe Salesman: A young married couple in Tehran find their marriage strained after a violent assault. The Salesman, which won the Foreign Language Oscar, is a social critique on family, gender and revenge.\n\nStories We Tell: Canadian filmmaker Sarah Polley\u2019s deeply personal documentary about her family\u2019s history involving a secret affair is a riveting and powerful film.\n\nWake in Fright: This classic 1971 Australian film was considered \u201clost\u201d for many years, until a copy was found in a vault in the US in the early 2000s. It tells the story of a city schoolteacher stranded in an outback town who throws himself into days of gambling, drinking and a bonkers kangaroo hunt.\n\nBlue is the Warmest Colour: The 2013 Palme d\u2019Or-winning queer love story is considered one of the best films of that year. Starring Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos, this French film is the story of two women and their bond from their teen years through to adulthood.\n\nUmberto D.: A classic of the Italian neorealist movement, Vittorio De Sica\u2019s 1952 movie is the story of a poor, retired government worker who is about to be evicted from his rental unit.\n\nMon Oncle: French comedy filmmaker Jacques Tati was a huge fan of Buster Keaton and that love of slapstick comedy is threaded through all of his works, including Mon Oncle, which in addition to being hilarious is also a scathing critique on modernity.\n\nYou Were Never Really Here: Maybe you think Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in Joker, but the foundations of that performance was laid in Lynne Ramsey\u2019s psychological thriller where Phoenix plays a traumatised and violent mercenary who\u2019s hired to recover a kidnapped girl.\n\nCarol: Todd Haynes\u2019 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s The Price of Salt is a sensual and urgent love story between two women \u2013 one a glamorous older woman (Cate Blanchett) and the other an aspiring photographer working in a department store (Rooney Mara).\n\nThe Wolfpack: This fascinating documentary by Crystal Moselle reveals the story of seven children homeschooled by their parents in their small New York City apartment. The kids had effectively been locked inside but everything changed when one of them decides to go for a walk.\n\nThe Babadook: Jennifer Kent\u2019s terrifying horror film received scant attention in Australia until it became an international hit. Starring Essie Davis, the Adelaide-set story is about a widowed mother and her six-year-old son who are haunted in their home.\n\nGirlhood: Celine Sciamma is winning plaudits all over for her passionate film  Portrait of a Lady on Fire, but her previous movie, Girlhood, is well worth a watch. Starring Karidja Toure as a teenage African teenager living in a disadvantaged area of Paris, Girlhood looks at conceptions of race, gender and class.\n\nFrances Ha: Directed by Noah Baumbach and co-written by Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, Frances Ha is a charming coming-of-age story about a dancer looking for her place in the world.\n\nPhoenix: A German drama starring Nina Hoss, Phoenix is the story of a concentration camp survivor who has a facial reconstruction because of a bullet wound. When she returns to Berlin after the war, her husband is convinced it\u2019s someone else.\n\nHeathers: One of the defining 80s teen comedies, Heathers is a pushback on the sentimentalism of John Hughes by making its lead characters damaged souls with a violent and anarchic streak.\n\nAin\u2019t Them Bodies Saints: David Lowery\u2019s crime drama stars Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara. When the couple are caught for illegal activities, Bob takes the blame and goes to prison. Four years later, he breaks out and promises to reunite with his family but there are three bounty hunters on his trail.\n\nI Am Not Your Negro: Directed by Raoul Peck, this documentary is based on writer James Baldwin\u2019s unfinished manuscript about the history of racism in the US. It recounts the lives of Baldwin\u2019s friends including Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.",

      "text": "The Notebook is now available to stream on Netflix.\n\nOPINION: It was June 2004. I was a teenager so proud of the mascara stains that trailed my cheeks. They were proof that I didn't just tear up; I cried so hard at The Notebook.\u00a0I felt invigorated, impassioned. I was alive!\n\nAnd I was thereafter obsessed with the movie.\n\nThe Nicholas Sparks adaptation, a 1940s-set romance starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling as summer lovers with family income discrepancies, would go on to inspire my MySpace wallpaper, top my \"favourite movies\" list and become required viewing for my confused high-school boyfriends.\n\nThat was then.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Romance novelist\u00a0Nicholas Sparks\u00a0apologises for anti-LGBTQ emails\n\n* Netflix UK changed the end of beloved film The Notebook\n\n* The Notebook is heading to Broadway\n\nRachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling starred in the movie.\n\nAhead of the drama's 15th anniversary on June 25, I decided to revisit the sob story now that I'm a less-hormonal 30. How would I like it?\n\nIt turns out, well, I would not. I would not like it at all.\n\nReader, I finally realised that The Notebook\u00a0is a dangerous dumpster fire. I am embarrassed that I fell for a tale about a stalker who likes the way a girl looks on a carnival ride, and so he spends the rest of his life pining for her, despite not appreciating anything else about her.\n\nHow do I despise The Notebook? Let me count the ways.\n\nHe spots her at a carnival, where she's laughing and crashing a bumper car, and instantly decides that she looks gorgeous and \"free\" and he must have her.\n\nAfter she politely declines his overtures, he follows her onto a Ferris wheel and proceeds to dangle from the ride by one hand, threatening to slip unless Allie agrees to go on a date with him. She's forced to say yes.\n\nEssentially, the film romanticises toxic relationships and promulgates an unhealthy culture of jerk worship.\n\nI'm forced to yell, \"This is bull!\" at my TV.\n\nOnce Allie and Noah get to talking, he insults her\n\nWhen they finally do get together, Allie opens up about her \"strict schedule\" of tutoring and music lessons, and Noah makes her feel insecure about not being as \"free\" as he believed. He convinces her to loosen up, to \"learn how to trust\", and to lie on the street with him until they're both almost run over by a car. She laughs, because, ha, they nearly died.\n\nHa. Ha. This is garbage that doesn't show how real, compatible humans fall in love. But the leads are so distractingly handsome, I didn't notice before.\n\nNoah and Allie don't actually like each other when they're not sucking face\n\nNoah and Allie spend a summer making out, yelling at each other for being annoying and learning that they have nothing in common. The closest thing they have to a real conversation is an inane chat about how if one if them had been a bird in another life, naturally, the other would've been, too.\n\nThey break up, but don't mean it. Noah writes Allie letters for 365 days in a row that go unanswered, and in the years that follow, makes no friends and decides that the single thing he should do with his life is restore a house for a girl he can't stand.\n\nIn Allie's titular notebook (from which this story is told via flashback with Gena Rowlands and James Garner as the elder Allie and Noah), she writes: \"They didn't agree on much. In fact, they rarely agreed on anything.\"\n\nCan we all agree that this is unhealthy? And, frankly, just bad storytelling?\n\nLon should be the hero of the story; instead he's the barrier\n\nWhile Allie is at college, Noah-less, she volunteers as a nurse's aide and meets Lon (played by James Marsden), a charming man in a full body cast. Once Lon (miraculously) heals, Allie accepts his offer to go dancing without being threatened to do so. They embark on a relationship filled with mutual respect, admiration and fondness for one another. By the way, Lon is rich, which is depicted as a character flaw.\n\nAfter they get engaged and Allie sees Noah's photo in the paper, she tells Lon she must take care of something.\n\n\"Take your time,\" Lon says, comfortingly. \"Do whatever you need to do.\"\n\nWhat Allie needs to do is visit Noah, sleep with him and swoon over him. That's before Noah starts yelling \"What do you want?!\" at her, and promising a future filled with fights.\n\n\"You tell me when I'm being an arrogant (S. O.B.) and I tell you when you're being a pain in the (butt), which you are 99 per cent\u00a0of the time!\" Noah shouts at her.\n\nWhat an offer of lifelong bliss!\n\nMeanwhile, Lon doesn't raise his voice after learning of Allie's infidelity.\n\n\"In spite of everything, I love you,\" he says. \"But I don't want to convince my fiance that she should be with me.\"\n\nNow tell me: Why would Allie choose Noah over Lon?\n\nProbably because she confuses security with boredom, and mistakes verbal abuse for passion. Also: She thinks that the fact that she no longer paints is an indicator that she's unhappy in her relationship. Really, it might be an indicator that she doesn't actually like to paint.\n\nThe Notebook\u00a0is bad but its messaging is worse\n\nHiding a shallow love story behind attractive actors isn't itself terribly negligent. But the movie does far worse than that.\n\nIt doesn't help that the film is tainted by recent news about its novelist. Sparks has been in headlines for sending and then apologising for past emails that object to \"an agenda that strives to make homosexuality open and accepted\".\n\nBut even on its own, The Notebook\u00a0teaches impressionable young women that they ought to be pursued by men who see them as prey. (Noah literally says this about Allie: \"When I see something that I like, well ... I go crazy for it.\")\n\nEssentially, the film romanticises toxic relationships and promulgates an unhealthy culture of jerk worship. My teenage self deserved better.\n\nI must admit, the geriatric scenes still get me\n\nFull disclosure: I still teared up at the scenes where old Noah insists on reading to old Allie, who has dementia and little chance of remembering him. Darn it, that is romantic!\n\nBut as for the rest of the movie, well, I'll say this: It still did make me feel a lot, like it did the first time. It's just that this time, I understood my emotions as anger.",

      "text": "After a whirlwind of six months, it seems like the honeymoon is over for Abbie Chatfield and Konrad Bien-Stephen with reports the reality star couple have split.\n\nThe news of their break up comes as Bien-Stephen, who shot to fame during his appearance on Brooke Blurton\u2019s season of The Bachelorette, is set to appear on a new reality tv series alongside several other Australian reality tv stars.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, the couple has been over for some time with 32-year-old Bien-Stephen already hooking up with another Bachie alumni.\n\nAn insider told the publication that Bien-Stephen had told his fellow co-stars on The Challenge Australia that he is single.\n\n\u201cKonrad said he was single and his relationship with Abbie was over because she broke up with him,\u201d an insider said.\n\nThe insider added that Bien-Stephen had hooked up with Megan Marx who appeared on Richie Strahan\u2019s season of The Bachelor.\n\nTo add more fuel to the fire, Blurton is set to appear in the new series, The Challenge, with an insider adding that it appeared as if Bien-Stephen was trying to make her jealous by hooking up with Marx.\n\n\u201cOh, my gosh! The drama is insane. Konrad is sleeping with Megan [Marx]... It was awkward because he was all over her the second we started filming. It was like he was trying to make Brooke [Blurton] jealous because she was there too,\u201d an insider said.\n\nThe source claimed Bien-Stephen and Marx couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other once the cameras were rolling.\n\nChatfield, who is currently one of the four superstar judges on the new season of The Masked Singer, has taken to Instagram to address the rumours.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the articles about Konrad. He\u2019s out of the country so i won\u2019t be commenting on anything until he\u2019s home,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram Story.\n\n\u201cCant everyone not be so dramatic pls and relax\u201d.\n\nChatfield and Bien-Stephen made headlines back in November when they announced their relationship.\n\nAt the time, Blurton\u2019s season of The Bachelorette was airing and Bien-Stephen was one of the frontrunners. Chatfield\u2019s relationship with Bien-Stephen led to the breakdown of her friendship with Blurton with the two Bachie alumni going head-to-head on social media.\n\nIn February, the podcast host revealed she and Bien-Stephen were in an open relationship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been upset or threatened by someone (I\u2019m in a relationship with) sleeping with someone else. It\u2019s my kink. I just never really valued monogamy that much,\u201d she told Stellar Magazine.\n\n\u201cIt sounds awful, but I don\u2019t really see him all that much, maybe two days a week. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s scarcity, but he\u2019s very good at communicating, and so am I.\u201d",

      "text": "The Girl in the Spider's Web is now screening.\n\nWhen Claire Foy was cast in the TV series\u00a0The Crown,\u00a0portraying Queen Elizabeth II, she realised it was a role with which she would be forever linked.\n\nBut despite the shadow cast by this career-defining part, which earned her an Emmy and a Golden Globe, the 34-year-old English actor has shed all traces of regal demeanour in her two new highly anticipated films.\n\nIn\u00a0The Girl in the Spider's Web, an extension of Stieg Larsson's\u00a0Millennium\u00a0trilogy, Claire becomes the third actor to portray ferocious Swedish goth vigilante Lisbeth Salander. In\u00a0First Man, she changes gears to play Janet Armstrong, the wife of American astronaut and moon walker Neil Armstrong, played by Ryan Gosling.\n\nLooking at the demure actress sitting across from me in NASA's media centre, it seems remarkable that she could so effortlessly inhabit such contrasting characters. She's wearing a simple cream JOSEPH dress and an elegant gold-leaf Lelet hairclip to keep her pixie cut out of her eyes.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* First Man delivers its best moments in quiet and unexpected places\n\n* Claire Foy: Crown pay gap issue 'definitely opened my eyes'\n\n* Six movies you must-see in October\n\n* The Crown: Who comes out on top in the royal style stakes?\n\n* 'First Man' fails to blast off behind 'Venom,' 'A Star Is Born' at the US Box office\n\n* Ryan Gosling's next project? Playing Neil Armstrong in First Man\n\nClaire Foy -\"Even if I make a mistake, it's likely to lead me to somewhere interesting. That's what I hope I can keep doing.\"\n\nIn person, she's someone else all over again; playful, funny and clearly excited about finally being able to visit NASA's Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, Florida, after missing out when other cast members came to research their\u00a0First Man\u00a0roles.\n\n\"I was in the 'other' movie, the one where Neil Armstrong was at home,\" Claire jokes, dangling her teabag in a paper cup, \"so I was excited when I heard we were doing publicity here!\"\n\nThe humble Brit has been on her own rocket ride since wrapping her second season of\u00a0The Crown in late 2017 and handing over the tiara to Olivia Colman because producers planned to skip a decade in the monarch's reign. However, Claire insists her new film roles are not part of any strategic plan.\n\n\"It's very rare that you are given the opportunity to really stretch your legs as an actor, especially to play someone who is so far beyond the reaches of myself, so I feel incredibly grateful and lucky I had that chance,\" she says. \"But I think if you just actively try to do something because it's the opposite of something else, you are going to make a terrible mistake.\n\n\"If I follow my gut and hope that leads me somewhere, even if I make a mistake, it's likely to lead me to somewhere interesting. That's what I hope I can keep doing.\"\n\nThe Girl in the Spider's Web will see Foy tackling a darker role than she's done before.\n\nDirected by Damien Chazelle, who won an Oscar for\u00a0La La Land, First Man focuses on Neil Armstrong in the 10 years leading up to the historic 1969 Apollo 11 flight and moonwalk. Based on a book by James R. Hansen, the film explores the triumphs and the sacrifices made by Armstrong, the other astronauts, and their families.\n\nWhen Ryan Gosling sits down to talk, he's eager to praise his co-star and agrees that she is remarkably devoid of ego.\n\n\"I was a fan of Claire in\u00a0The Crown\u00a0and every time I saw her, either in her work or on an award show or something, she'd walk away from a situation leaving a giant mushroom cloud where anything pretentious used to be,\" Gosling says fondly. \"She has an incredible ability to just cut out the pretence.\"\n\nWhen Janet Armstrong passed away earlier this year (Neil Armstrong died in 2012, aged 82), Claire admits she was devastated.\n\n\"Ryan got to meet her but there was a hurricane and weather issues and my flight was cancelled,\" she sighs. \"I always thought I'd get another chance and I'll always regret that I didn't.\"\n\nShe was honoured that Janet and Neil Armstrong's two sons, Rick and Mark, offered to share intimate details about their parents that ran the gamut from what cereal they ate for breakfast to how she tucked them in at night.\n\nClaire's blue eyes well up as she adds, \"They were incredibly generous, sharing so much of their mum with me, and if I talk about it too much I'll start bawling.\"\n\nThe Girl in the Spider's Web hits cinemas November 8.\n\nBorn in Stockport, near Manchester, Claire grew up in Buckinghamshire as the youngest of three children. She enjoyed drama in her early years but by the time she was 11 she was gravitating more towards sports. At 13, however, she was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and could no longer participate in athletic activities.\n\nFive years later, a tumour was discovered growing behind her eye, but it was benign and treated successfully with surgery and steroids. Looking back, she chooses to label these challenges as life-affirming.\n\n\"It was horrible and debilitating, but it made me realise that I needed to grab the life I wanted,\" she told British\u00a0Vogue\u00a0about her cancer scare. \"If that hadn't happened, I don't know if I would have been brave enough to study drama.\"\n\nAfter making up her mind, and training at the Oxford School of Drama, Claire made her professional debut at the Royal National Theatre in London. A steady string of credits followed, including the 2008 BBC miniseries\u00a0Little Dorrit, her movie debut opposite Nicolas Cage in Season of the\u00a0Witch\u00a0in 2011, and the 2015 miniseries\u00a0Wolf Hall, which earned her a BAFTA nomination.\n\nThroughout her career, Claire has played deeply complex characters but she bristles at the suggestion they can all be labelled \"strong women\".\n\n\"I have absolutely no interest in portraying what other people think of as strong. It's a way of making women more acceptable in a male world, and I am just not on board with that,\" she declares in her no-nonsense English accent. \"I don't think women are crying out to see strong women; I think we know we are all strong but we're just crying out to see women on screen at all!\"\n\nIn her role as Lisbeth Salander in\u00a0The Girl in the Spider's Web, Claire trades her buttermilk complexion for a body adorned with tattoos and also sports a jagged, super-short haircut. It's her attempt to reinvent the role previously played by Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara.\n\n\"I'd already re-read all the books and I just started thinking about what I didn't want to do,\" she says.\n\n\"I felt very strongly that I didn't want to just say she has a mohawk and loads of tattoos and the job's done. I wanted to go back and understand why she has those things and why she wants to create a veneer of unapproachability so I could make sense of it.\"\n\nShe admits the task of having the tattoos applied and removed was both time-consuming and tedious. \"Very occasionally, at family parties, I'd look down and be like, 'Oh look, I've still got that one on!' \" she says, giggling.\n\nThis is the first reference Claire has made to the fact she has a family, and she's quick to shut down any questions about her split earlier this year from her actor husband, Stephen Campbell Moore. And she will not speak about their three-year-old daughter, Ivy.\n\n\"I don't feel comfortable talking about my family, I'm afraid,\" she says, firmly but politely. Spending time with Gosling, who navigates intrusions of privacy on a daily basis, she seems horrified this might be in her future. \"I've always said that if it becomes too much, I won't do it any more,\" she says.\n\nNaturally funny and self-deprecating, the woman\u00a0First Man\u00a0director Damien Chazelle describes as \"one of the greatest actresses of her generation\" sheepishly admits the trappings of fame aren't all bad.\n\nWhen Claire attended the 2017 Golden Globes as a nominee for the Best Actress in a TV Drama award, she was overcome with excitement even before she found herself on stage accepting the award.\n\n\"I saw Meryl Streep and there's no way you feel you can go up to someone you admire that much and tell her what she means to you,\" she says.\n\n\"I try to remember that everyone goes to the toilet, but at award shows everyone really does go to the toilet, and when you come back, suddenly you are sitting next to Stevie Wonder. Your heart is pounding but you just casually say 'Hello Stevie' because it's too normal for it to be weird!\"\n\nGiven her current big-screen takeover, Claire Foy may have to start regarding such situations as her new normal.\n\nFirst Man\u00a0is in cinemas now.\u00a0The Girl in the Spider's Web\u00a0is out on November 8.",

      "text": "Blade Runner 2049 is now available to download and on DVD and Blu-Ray.\n\nWhen rewatching the original Blade Runner (1982) in anticipation of the most-heralded movie event of 2017, one is struck by several thoughts.\n\nPrincipally, there is a disorienting sense that what you're watching is more familiar from the myriad cinematic moments imitated in subsequent movies \u2013 from the Vangelis synth soundtrack and rain-drenched dystopia to the soaring cinematography across its night-time cityscapes.\n\nYou also notice how optimistic director Ridley Scott was 35 years ago, when envisaging the technology we might hope to see in 2019 (the year that Harrison Ford's Deckard first hunted replicants on the big screen). Granted, characters make video calls (albeit only using payphones), but we've nearly caught up time-wise and I'm still waiting for someone to invent a domestic step-inside hair-dryer.\n\nThirty years on, Agent K (Ryan Gosling) is an LAPD-employed blade runner, tasked with \"retiring\" the older model replicants who provoked rebellion in times past. He stumbles upon a cold case mystery which his boss (Robin Wright) wants silenced, but which deepens into a rabbit hole from which he cannot climb out.\n\nHarrison Ford and Ryan Gosling make for a terrific combo in Blade Runner 2049.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Blade Runner 2049 getting rave reviews from critics\n\n*\u00a0Blade Runner 2049 final trailer exposes more plot, keeps more surprises\n\n*\u00a0Weta add touch of magic to Blade Runner 2049\n\n*\u00a0Blade Runner trailer has Ryan Gosling follow Harrison Ford's\u00a0footsteps, literally\n\nAs it turns out, the first rule of discussing the new Blade Runner is to not say very much at all. With a well-written plot which pairs professional duty with personal yearning, the clever intricacies are best left for the viewer to discover. But since the second rule of the new Blade Runner is its fans already know who they are, it must be said that you should not venture into 2049's near\u00a0three-hour run-time until you've watched its forerunner.\n\nTo this end, the thrills of celebrated director Denis Villeneuve's (Incendies, Sicario, Arrival) gorgeous update derive largely from the evident reverence shown to the source material. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack lands smartly somewhere between Vangelis-esque and the motifs of Villeneuve's regular collaborator, Johann Johannsson, and the world-building so emblematic in the first film is expanded here, with dimly lit rooms, shimmering water shadows and Villeneuve's trademark golden hues.\n\nThe world-building, so emblematic in the original Blade Runner, is expanded here.\n\nThe writing team, too, seems like an astute choice: old-timer Hampton Fancher, one of the original writers on Blade Runner, whose subsequent writing credits have mostly revolved around that title, and younger-bod Michael Green, who birthed more contemporary action dramas Logan and Alien: Covenant.\n\nBut as to its pace, be warned: Blade Runner 2049 is no modern-day action-thriller, and its rewards are instead delivered by being smart, interesting and very languid.\n\nApart from our male leads (Gosling is terrific and Ford shows more emotion in his dotage) and the contemporary powerhouse that is Robin Wright, the cast comprises mostly unfamiliar faces, hailing from Cuba, Hungary, Sweden, Somalia and even South London.\n\nAna De Armas & Sylvia Hoeks talk about working with Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford on Blade Runner 2049, and the secrecy around the film.\n\nThe women are suitably strong and beautiful, and although there are a few too many nude female figures on display, the story's sexual content is intellectually interesting in its rendering, but too tricksy to evoke either sexual or emotional feeling. (At least there's no dubious, squirm-inducing \"love scene\" like they did it back in 1982.)\n\nVilleneuve has taken the double-edged sword of the update and created a Blade Runner 2049 worthy of honouring its ancestor, while bringing it appropriately into the mid-21st Century.",

Written and Directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Amiee Conn this is the official \"Dreamers\" Trailer for the hot film 'La La Land' i\n\nPeople are going gaga for La La Land, and probably the nicest thing about this fact is that it shows that contemporary audiences once again have an appetite for musicals.\n\nHuh? That's right \u2013 it's important you know there are song-and-dance routines, because that's not for everyone, but if anyone is going to convert your long-held prejudices, it's Damien \"Whiplash\" Chazelle. And if you're already sold, just jump on board.\n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone are shaping up to be today's equivalent of Garland and Rooney, this third outing (after Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad) demonstrating yet again their chemistry and endearing camaraderie.\n\nThe chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is there for all to see in La La Land.\n\nSebastian is a jazz pianist struggling to turn a dream into reality; Mia is an aspiring actress who serves coffee to actual actresses at one of Hollywood's major studios. Just as in the MGM musicals of yore, they meet-cute (tick), their initial animosity gradually translates into affection (tick) and they unselfconsciously segue into naturalistic singing and well-rehearsed dancing which is guaranteed to bring a smile to every audience member's face. The allusions to Singin' in the Rain are fun to spot, but La La Land's real charm is in the fact these actors are not indentured musical monkeys from an era 60 years ago, but tangibly real people who give the impression of just being themselves.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0 Ryan Gosling goes ga ga for La La Land\n\n*\u00a0 La La Land, Moonlight among winners at Critics' Choice Awards\n\n*\u00a0Ryan Gosling, Emma\u00a0Stone\u00a0channel humble career starts in\u00a0La La Land\n\nGiven the eviscerating script and harsh lessons of Whiplash (one of the instant classics of 2014), Chazelle may seem a strange choice to helm a modern-day, feel-good musical. However, the director's love of jazz is front and centre, and once again his actors stepped up to the \"I'll do this myself\" plate, with Gosling playing his own piano numbers, Stone's breathy voice bringing a naturalistic charm, and the pair doing a damn fine job of mimicking the moves of Reynolds and Kelly in one delightful night-time scene.\n\nAs a depiction of Hollywood, the observations are bang-on (the distracted casting directors, the audition waiting room full of clones), but Chazelle masks most of the unpleasant aspects with gorgeous primary-colour-blocked costumes and catchy tunes you've never heard before.\n\nFrom the one-shot opening scene in which an unlikely joyous traffic jam turns into a dance routine complete with modern-day touches of parkour and BMXers, through to Stone's wonderfully powerful closing number, La La Land takes us back to a time when we'd watch movies just to say \"now that's entertainment\".",

      "text": "Blade Runner 2049 is now available to download and on DVD and Blu-Ray.\n\nWhen Denis Villeneuve first showed Blade Runner 2049 to Ridley Scott, he wasn't sure exactly what he had. But he knew he had something.\n\nHe had spent months paring an hour-and-15-minutes off his initial, four-hour rough cut of the film \u2013\u00a0a belated sequel to Scott's own monumental science-fiction/film noir hybrid, about a detective hunting lifelike androids in a desolate future Los Angeles.\n\nBy the time of that test screening, nothing else seemed dispensable. And though Scott would later grumpily describe the 163-minute version as \"way too f...ing\u00a0long\", saying he would have trimmed another half-hour from it, the studio executives were more warily upbeat. They'd given the director of Sicario and Arrival\u00a0US$185 million to make a mature and uncompromising sequel to Blade Runner, and for better or worse, that was exactly what he had delivered. Four months on, Villeneuve recalls one of his producers' gut reactions word for word: \"The lights came up, and he turned around and said, 'We've just made the most expensive art house movie in cinema history'.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Blade Runner 2049 getting rave reviews from critics\n\n*\u00a0Blade Runner 2049 final trailer exposes more plot, keeps more surprises\n\n*\u00a0Weta add touch of magic to Blade Runner 2049\n\n*\u00a0Blade Runner trailer has Ryan Gosling follow Harrison Ford's\u00a0footsteps, literally\n\nOf all the things that have been written about Blade Runner 2049, none capture it more snappily than that. Even in a strong year for blockbusters, Villeneuve's stood apart from the pack: it was enormous, introspective, coldly beautiful and unapologetically oblique, not even caring to clarify which of its characters were robotic replicants and which were flesh and blood. (A warning: mild spoilers lie ahead.)\n\nReleased last October in a fog of secrecy, the reviews of the film mostly ranged from positive to euphoric, and the industry itself has been equally dazzled. Blade Runner 2049 is in contention for five Oscars and eight Baftas, including a Bafta Best Director nomination for Villeneuve. Yet it fell far short of even conservative box office predictions. The film fared notably better in Europe than the United States \u2013\u00a0\"Europe saved my ass,\" Villeneuve jokes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but it was quickly branded a bomb, and its production company Alcon Entertainment is likely to lose $80 million.\n\nUp next for Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve? A little sci-fi saga called Dune.\n\nWhen we meet in a fashionably sterile London hotel room \u2013\u00a0high-rise, low lights, the purr of air conditioning overhead\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the 50-year-old French-Canadian admits the film's wildly unbalanced reception means it will probably remain a one-off.\n\n\"Let's just say it would not be a good idea for me to make a movie like that twice,\" he chuckles, in mellowly accented English. \"When you're working on a film you're in a bubble, and it was only when I came out that I realised we had made a monster.\"\n\nIt's also only now that he is able to dissect it. During the original press tour, the studio didn't screen the film for fear of plot leaks, \"and I was really tired of talking about the film with journalists who hadn't seen it\",\u00a0he says. With its mighty heritage and stars like Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, it was by far the biggest film Alcon had ever handled. \"And they wanted it to be a total secret, like Star Wars,\" Villeneuve says. \"They didn't want anyone to know a thing about it.\"\n\nAna De Armas & Sylvia Hoeks talk about working with Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford on Blade Runner 2049, and the secrecy around the film.\n\nFor his part, Villeneuve lobbied for a more open approach. \"I didn't want people to think we were afraid to show it,\" he says. So they did, once. A few days later, a story surfaced in the media that Sean Young, who played Rachel in the original film, made a cameo in the new one, as had long been rumoured. The studio \"just closed up, like that\",\u00a0Villeneuve says, and hunches over with a theatrical slurp.\n\nBut marketing leaks couldn't spoil the film's mysteries, and it's only on a second encounter that many of Blade Runner 2049's more elaborate puzzles open up. Take that opening close-up of a green-blue eye: it doesn't belong to Ryan Gosling's replicant detective K, as you might assume, but to Carla Juri's Dr Stelline, the author of the synthetic memories that tip off K to the seismic implications of his latest missing-person case.\n\nThis means the actual first shot of K in the film is the one of him waking up in a police hover-car as it arrives at a sprawling protein farm \u2013\u00a0itself structured like a huge, grey iris in the desert. The film already forces us to reassess who K actually is twice. Does the eye shot and its implied connection to the film's final moments suggest a further level of ambiguity is there to unpick?\n\nBlade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve says the producers of the film wanted it to be a \"total secret\".\n\nVilleneuve grinningly declines to spell it out, but does say that he cooked up the image with his cinematographer Roger Deakins, a 13-time Oscar bridesmaid whose work on Blade Runner 2049 might well break his duck. He also says he toyed with calling the film Android's Dream, a tribute to the Philip K Dick novel that inspired the original film, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\n\nDick's book was published in 1968 when Villeneuve was one year old; Scott's film of it was released in 1982 when he was 15, and alongside Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Scott's own Alien, it was a formative influence. His first film, August 32nd on Earth (1998), was released when he was 29, and his second, Maelstrom, two years later. But he was disappointed with both, and took a nine-year sabbatical as a stay-at-home dad, vowing to return \"when I was ready to make a film I could be proud of\". Instead, he came back with two, and the second, the twisting war thriller Incendies (2010), piqued Hollywood's appetite.\n\nAnd despite Blade Runner's commercial struggles, he remains something of a flavour of the month. Eon Productions recently approached him to direct the as-yet-untitled 25th James Bond film, but he turned them down to direct and co-write a new cinema adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, \"a project I've been dreaming of since I was 14 years old\".\n\nVisually stunning it may have been, but Blade Runner 2049 lost a lot of money at the box office.\n\nHis Bond ambition remains undimmed, though. \"One day I would love to do one, but it's a question of timing. And it is very difficult to do a Bond movie well. I think what Martin Campbell did with Casino Royale was impressive, but now, where to go? I haven't had time to dream about it yet.\"\n\nBesides, Dune is enough to be getting on with. Ignoring the 1984 David Lynch version, he's adapting the 1965 novel from scratch with Eric Roth, whose unmade screenplay with Michael Mann, Comanche, is, Villeneuve says, \"one of the best I've ever read\". And the writing process has given him a break from increasingly gigantic and high-stakes film sets.\n\n\"I made five movies in six years, which is a privilege but also not a good idea,\" he says. \"I haven't had time to think about any of it. I kept feeling like I lacked time, so now to have so much of it feels...\"\n\nDenis Villeneuve spent months paring an hour-and-15-minutes off his initial, four-hour rough cut of Blade Runner 2049.\n\nLike a holiday? He smiles and shakes his head.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is now\u00a0available to download and\u00a0on DVD and Blu-ray.",

      "text": "LONDON: Influential and inspirational South Asians in a range of fields in the UK were honored recently, during a prestigious ceremony in London, for their outstanding achievements.\n\nEstablished in 2000, the Asian Achievers Awards, one of the most prominent and long-established celebrations of its kind, returned for its 20th edition after a two-year hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizers chose to pay tribute this year to the legacy of Queen Elizabeth II, who died on Sept. 8, and renamed the Woman of the Year Award in her honor.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the evening is to recognize changemakers from across the South Asian community in the UK,\u201d Pratik Dattani, the director of the awards, told Arab News. \u201cIt really is the cream of the community and everyone really worth celebrating.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s awards were presented in 12 categories: art and culture; business leadership; community service; entrepreneur and professional of the year; media; sports; health; innovation; uniformed and civil service; women of the year; and lifetime achievement.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to have South Asians in prominent positions because it\u2019s about leadership in the community, mentorship, and having visible role models,\u201d Dattani said.\n\nHe added that the current mayor and the deputy mayors of London come from South Asian backgrounds, the UK cabinet during the past 12 years has included, on average, four ministers of Indian or Pakistani origin, and the richest person in the UK is of South Asian origin.\n\n\u201cThis just shows the immense contribution we make to the cultural, social and economic fabric of the country, he said.\n\n\u201cSouth Asians in the UK are here to stay but the growth, the economic success and the community success of the South Asian community will grow and the awards will continue to be the place in the UK, and across Europe, where we recognize South Asian excellence.\u201d\n\nDattani said that the proceeds from the event, held at JW Marriott Grosvenor House, will go to Pardada Pardadi Educational Society UK, a charity that helps underprivileged children across India and South Asia. In all, he said, it raised more than \u00a3150,000 ($165,945), with additional commitments of more than \u00a3100,000.\n\nUK Home Secretary Suella Braverman received the newly renamed Queen Elizabeth II Woman of the Year award, which her parents accepted on her behalf.\n\n\u201cI think from the start, our mantra has been: \u2018Suella you\u2019ve got to study hard and you\u2019ve got to do well if you want to get anywhere,\u2019\u201d said her mother, Uma Fernanades.\n\n\u201cAnd I think being of ethnic minority, and also being a lady, it\u2019s harder still and (requires) us to work doubly hard, and she has done that.\n\n\u201cAnother thing I used to say to her, whenever she passes an exam or she gets a degree, I always used to say, \u2018This is not just for you, it\u2019s for the whole community out there and you\u2019ve got to learn to share it.\u2019 And I think I would want to know that she\u2019s setting an example; that she\u2019s just an ordinary woman, just like anybody else, but if you want to achieve something, you can do it.\u201d\n\nCapt. Harpreet Chandi MBE, an officer and physiotherapist in the British Army, received the Uniformed and Civil Service Award. She recently completed a 700-mile solo, unsupported expedition to the South Pole that took 40 days.\n\n\u201cWhen I had the idea, I didn\u2019t know anything about Antarctica; I literally typed into Google, \u2018How do you get to Antarctica as a modern-day explorer?\u2019\u201d she said. It took her about two and a half years to actually get onto the ice.\n\n\u201cI became the first woman of color to do a solo expedition but that was just a journey \u2014 then I got back and I did about four months of school talks and reached about 18,000 students, just hoping to inspire the next generation,\u201d Chandi said.\n\nShe is preparing to return to Antarctica in a month with the aim of becoming the first woman to complete a solo, unsupported crossing of the continent. She plans to cover 1,100 miles in 70 days.\n\n\u201cMy aims are hopefully to inspire people to push their boundaries and show that, actually, it doesn\u2019t matter what you look like or where you\u2019re from, you can go and achieve anything you want and no barrier or boundary is too (great),\u201d Chandi said.\n\n\u201cI really want to encourage people to step outside of their comfort zone and do whatever they want and achieve whatever they want.\u201d\n\nPrema Subaskaran, chairperson of Lycahealth and KIMS Hospital, won the Outstanding Achievement in Healthcare Award and said it was a \u201cgreat privilege\u201d to be recognized for her efforts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really passionate about health care and I really wanted to become a doctor and serve the people, but because of the civil war (in Sri Lanka) and family commitments, I couldn\u2019t and I had to stop my degree in the middle,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThen I always wanted to set up a business that could facilitate philanthropic work through the field of medicine by working with like-minded people, so this is how I set up Lycahealth in 2015.\u201d\n\nWith a focus on providing patients with a complete diagnostic pathway and secondary care, Lycahealth last year acquired KIMS Hospital, the largest independent private hospital in the English county of Kent.\n\n\u201cWe play a critical role in Kent to provide outstanding health care to the local community, as well as becoming a big employer in the local community,\u201d Subaskaran added.",

      "text": "Hollywood\u2019s brightest are commanding enormous, eye-popping pay cheques to flash their pearly veneers at the camera, the kind of money that would make even lottery winners jealous.\n\nIndustry bible Variety has released a list of what the top actors have earnt for their recent or upcoming films and, unsurprisingly, Tom Cruise tops the list.\n\nCruise is estimated to rake in over $US100 million for his work on Top Gun: Maverick, with the vast majority of that money coming from the blockbuster sequel\u2019s huge box office.\n\nCruise is one of the few talents in the industry who still commands what is called \u201cfirst-dollar gross\u201d, a lucrative deal which sees him paid a set percentage of the entire box office and not just profits. This means even if a film lost money after production and marketing costs, Cruise would still get paid.\n\nIn the case of Top Gun: Maverick \u2013 the box office is currently on $US1.24 billion and still going \u2013 Cruise will collect big. His deal is said to also include a back-end percentage of digital rentals, DVDs and streaming revenue.\n\nStream more entertainment news live & on demand with Flash. 25+ news channels in 1 place.

Offer ends 31 October, 2022 >\n\nHe is also slated to take home upfront salaries of between $US12 million to $US14 million for the two upcoming Mission Impossible sequels. He likely has a similar \u201cfirst-dollar gross\u201d deal for those two films.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan is said to be another figure who commands a \u201cfirst-dollar gross\u201d deal.\n\nThe actor sitting in second position on the top salary charts is Will Smith, who was paid $US35 million for his role in Apple TV+ movie Emancipation, which was greenlit and filmed before he assaulted Chris Rock onstage during the live Oscars broadcast.\n\nApple seems to be very generous with its stars as it seeks to establish itself as a power player in the industry. It also shelled out $US30 million for Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s involvement in Killers Of The Flower Moon, a Martin Scorsese crime drama that will also star Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons and Lily Gladstone.\n\nBrad Pitt was, similarly, the beneficiary of Apple\u2019s largesse, taking home a $US30 million pay cheque for his role in an upcoming, still untitled, drama set in the world of Formula 1. Top Gun: Maverick director Joe Kosinski will helm the project while UK F1 driver Lewis Hamilton is one of the producers. Pitt\u2019s production company Plan B is also on-board.\n\nStreaming companies often pay well upfront to compensate for the lack of back-end profits that could have been generated from a cinema release.\n\nIn the same vein, Chris Hemsworth was paid $US20 million for the sequel to Netflix action flick Extraction, which became the streaming platform\u2019s most watched original movie.\n\nNetflix also paid up to lure Millie Bobby Brown back for the sequel to Enola Holmes. She was paid $US10 million for the next instalment.\n\nThe highest ranked woman on the list doesn\u2019t come into play until the equal 16th spot, and it goes to Margot Robbie who is being paid $12.5 million for her role in Barbie. Her co-star Ryan Gosling is being paid the same amount but Robbie may be commanding more separately as she is also a producer on the Greta Gerwig film through her company LuckyChap Entertainment.\n\nElsewhere, donning a comic book costume continues to be lucrative with Dwayne Johnson being paid $US22.5 million for DC movie Black Adam while Tom Hardy will rake in $US20 million for Venom 3. Jason Momoa\u2019s payday for the next Aquaman flick will be $US15 million while Joaquin Phoenix will command $US20 million for the Joker sequel.\n\nAccording to Variety, Phoenix made a comparatively paltry $US4.5 million on the first Joker movie but the film then went on to take in over $US1 billion at the box office and also won a swag of awards including an Oscar for Phoenix.\n\nOver on the TV side, the salaries are lower despite producing more hours of entertainment.\n\nWhile some top-tier talent can still ask for $US 1 million per episode, there are fewer episodes in TV in the current era, compared to when the stars of Friends were being paid $US1 million per episode for seasons that ran for 24 episodes a year.\n\nStreaming shows typically number between six and 10 episodes per season while broadcast shows have a longer run.\n\nOnly two multi-Oscar winners are commanding above $US1 million per episode with Mahershala Ali and Kevin Costner both taking home $US1.3 million per episode for their shows The Pilot and Yellowstone, respectively.\n\nElsewhere, those being paid $US1 million per episode include Elisabeth Moss for Shining Girls, Michael Keaton for Dopesick, Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren for 1923, Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd for The Shrink Next Door, Jason Sudeikis for Ted Lasso, Sylvester Stallone for Tulsa King, an upcoming series from Taylor Sheridan and Terrence Winter.\n\nTV salaries seem to be better spread between men and women, at least at the upper echelons, with the likes of Rose Byrne, Brie Larson and Anne Hathaway also high on the charts.\n\n\u2022 Will Ferrell, The Shrink Next Door \u2013 $US1 million per episode\n\n\u2022 Paul Rudd, The Shrink Next Door \u2013 $US1 million per episode",

      "text": "Most Canadians who grew up in the '80s and '90s remember \u201cPopular Mechanics for Kids,\u201d the fun (yet educational!) series that aired from 1997 to 2001 on BBC Kids Canada and Discover Kids. It was, after all, the reason so many Canadians now understand how they make those giant Lego sculptures, how to make slime at home, and the safety statistics of skydiving. And where would we all be today without such crucial information? We\u2019d still be experimenting with household materials to find the right formula for green goop instead of being functional members of society, that\u2019s what.\n\nClearly, the effects of this classic piece of children\u2019s television have reverberated long after it went off the air \u2013 and not only for its young audience, either. Let\u2019s see how \u201cPMK\u201d helped to boost the careers of its five cast members.\n\nBefore she became a household name, Canadian kids just knew her just as Elisha, the plucky blonde host of \u201cPMK.\u201d Cuthbert's work on the show (which she did from ages 15 to 19) even got the attention of Hillary Clinton, who suggested \u201cPMK\u201d include a segment on salmonella poisoning, which they did. But after \u201cPMK\u201d ended, Cuthbert moved to Hollywood and got her big break as Kim Bauer on the hit action TV series \u201c24,\u201d opposite Kiefer Sutherland. Her film career has been less noteworthy, with minor roles in \u201cOld School\u201d and \u201cLove Actually\u201d and a starring turn in the horror \u201cHouse of Wax.\u201d But today, Cuthbert is best known for playing Alex in the cult comedy TV series \u201cHappy Endings,\u201d alongside Damon Wayans Jr. and Casey Wilson. She also dated NHL player Sean Avery from 2005 to 2007, but is now engaged to the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Dion Phaneuf.\n\nSo what if he was only a host for the first season? \u201cPMK\u201d helped launched the career of the actor who is now the darling of Canadian independent film. After leaving the show in 1998 at the age of 16, Baruchel went on to appear in small roles in acclaimed films like \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d and \u201cMillion Dollar Baby.\u201d But his biggest boost was falling in with Judd Apatow and his crew of goofy buddy actors. He starred in the short-lived TV series \u201cUndeclared\u201d with Seth Rogen, Charlie Hunnam, and Jason Segel, and appeared in the 2007 hit \u201cKnocked Up\u201d as well as the upcoming apocalypse comedy \u201cThis Is the End.\u201d\n\nBack in Canada, Baruchel is best known for indie films like \u201cThe Trotsky\u201d and \u201cGoon.\u201d He met fellow Canadian actress Allison Pill on the set of \u201cGoon\u201d in 2010, and the pair got engaged that December. Sadly, Canada\u2019s \u201cIt\u201d couple broke it off this month.\n\nTyler Kyte (a.k.a. \u201cJay\u2019s replacement\u201d) has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that boasts small roles on \u201cAre You Afraid of the Dark?\u201d and \u201cGoosebumps\u201d (a rite of passage for any Canadian actor of the \u201890s -- that goes for you, too, Ryan Gosling and Scott Speedman). And though Kyte hasn\u2019t experienced the same success of his former costars south of the border, he has still kept busy in Canada on the TV series \u201cInstant Star\u201d and in TV movies like \u201cProm Queen: The Marc Hall Story\u201d and \u201cThe Elizabeth Smart Story.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also had a pretty impressive music career, playing drums in the Toronto band Sweet Thing, who released their debut full-length album in 2010, as well as singing backup for Nick Rose & the Magnolias and playing in the folk band Blue Fox. He also released a solo EP in 2005 called \u201cLet\u2019s Talk.\u201d\n\nSince her stint as the roving reporter on \u201cPMK,\u201d Vanessa Lengies has kept busy! She was a regular on the NBC series \u201cAmerican Dreams\u201d from 2002 to 2006 (alongside Brittany Snow), and recently nabbed a recurring role on \u201cGlee\u201d as Sugar Motta. The 27-year-old actress will also reportedly appear on the upcoming comedy series \u201cMixology,\u201d playing a an optimistic personal trainer.\n\nAs the eldest, and the only American cast member of \u201cPopular Mechanics for Kids\u201d, Texas native Charles Powell (or, \u201cCharlie\u201d) had already appeared in a number of small roles in the United States and around the world, most notably 1997\u2019s \u201cAffliction,\u201d starring Nick Nolte and Sissy Spacek. He also starred as President Harold Bates on the YTV show \u201c15/Love,\u201d about a group of teens at an academy for aspiring tennis players.\n\nPowell, 49, now lives in New York City with his wife and two kids.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse us, we'll just be ordering the DVDs of \"Popular Mechanics for Kids.\"",

      "text": "Watford will be looking to extend their winning run in the Championship to four consecutive games when Coventry City visit Vicarage Road on Saturday afternoon.\n\nBoth sides have improved their form of late and both enjoyed victories in their most recent league fixtures, with Watford defeating Cardiff City and Coventry seeing off Blackburn Rovers.\n\nHeaded goals from Francisco Sierralta and Ismaila Sarr completed a comeback in Cardiff for Watford on Wednesday night as they left South Wales with a 2-1 win and three points that meant they entered the top six in the Championship for the first time since Slaven Bilic took over from Rob Edwards eight games ago.\n\nThings did not start swimmingly for the Hornets' new boss as they lost two of their opening three, but four wins in their last five have seen them climb to a position that the club's hierarchy would see as a minimum requirement by the final kick in May.\n\nDespite the improvement in results recently, Bilic bemoaned his side's sloppiness at the start of proceedings at the Cardiff City Stadium which allowed the hosts to take an early lead through a Cedric Kipre header, although he praised his team for then dominating the rest of the game and being deserved winners on the night.\n\nWatford would love to continue a run of two wins on the bounce in front of their home fans by getting the better of Coventry on Saturday, with the most recent of those victories coming in emphatic fashion by beating local rivals Luton Town 4-0 at Vicarage Road nearly a fortnight ago.\n\nWith things beginning to click between a talented group of players, the Watford fans will be hoping their team can further close the gap between them and the automatic promotion places before the World Cup break in three matches' time.\n\nJamie Allen's second goal of the campaign secured a noteworthy three points for Coventry at home to Blackburn on Wednesday night, lifting the club out of the bottom three and into 20th position in the second tier.\n\nThere were doubts the match would be fulfilled due to the company owning the Coventry Building Society Arena going into administration earlier this week, but the Championship show went on and provided a crucial three points for Mark Robins's side, who have endured a disruptive start to their campaign due to ongoing issues at their home ground.\n\nThe Sky Blues have won four of their last six in the league, propelling them out of the bottom three even though the West Midlands club still have two games in hand over the vast majority of teams in the division, with it possible that they go as high as 10th if they were to win those postponed fixtures.\n\nSwedish striker Viktor Gyokeres has resumed his role as leading marksmen for Coventry after a breakout season last year, currently topping the goalscoring charts with five strikes from 16 appearances so far this campaign, whereas dynamic midfielder Gustavo Hamer is continuing to show glimpses of immense quality, with no better example than his solo run and finish at Stoke City two weeks ago.\n\nWatford captain Tom Cleverley confirmed on Wednesday that he recently underwent surgery for an Achilles injury and will not be back in action until February as he begins a three-month rehabilitation process.\n\nThere were no fresh knocks picked up during the win at Cardiff on Wednesday night, but Jeremy Ngakia (hamstring) and Rey Manaj (leg) both remain out and may not feature until after the World Cup break.\n\nCoventry boss Robins is not expecting to see striker Martyn Waghorn in his matchday squads until post-World Cup after he sustained a hamstring injury in the win over Sheffield United, a game in which the experienced forward scored the winner from the penalty spot.\n\nWing-back Fankaty Dabo is another player that will not be seen until December when the Championship resumes after he tore his thigh in the 2-2 draw at Rotherham United two matches ago.\n\nAfter an early-season wobble, Watford are beginning to show why they were promotion favourites at the start of the season as they look to secure an immediate return to the Premier League under the new stewardship of Bilic.\n\nCoventry have enjoyed a good run of form recently, but it is hard to back against the hosts at Vicarage Road on Saturday after they have recorded convincing home wins against Norwich City and Luton most recently.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.",

      "text": "Compared to Wall St, 2015's The Big Short offered a very different look at America's financial institutions.\n\nLike its subject matter, Steve Carrell's latest\u00a0The Big Short\u00a0is hard to describe.\n\nBased on Michael Lewis' best-selling 2010 nonfiction book about a small group of money managers who made millions by betting against the housing market during the subprime mortgage crisis, the film is part comedy and part drama.\n\nIt even includes tongue-in-cheek documentary segments featuring Selena Gomez and Margot Robbie (in a bubble bath) explaining to the camera abstruse concepts of high finance.\n\nSteve Carell plays Mark Baum, the moral heart of The Big Short\n\nDirected by Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy), the film features an ensemble cast led by Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt and Steve Carell as Mark Baum, an amusingly abrasive yet self-righteous character based on real-life money manager Steve Eisman.\n\nWe spoke with Carell recently about the nature of satire and defying expectations:\n\nWP: I heard an interesting comment from a viewer after a screening of The Big Short.\u00a0She said she felt like throwing up. I'm not sure if she meant it as a compliment, but I wonder if it can be taken as one.\n\nSC: I think anyone involved with the movie would take that as a compliment. Certainly Adam McKay. If not vomit-inducing, he described it to me as it would be some sort of gut punch at the end. I think that's great.\n\nSteve Carell and Ryan Gosling face off in The Big Short\n\nWP: I What is the intended response? Outrage to the point of nausea? Laughter? Emotional connection with the characters?\n\nSC: \u00a0All of those responses are terrific. That's what Adam had in mind. When I first met him, he said, first and foremost that he wanted it to be entertaining. It's very dry material and very complicated. He didn't want it to become a two-hour lecture on subprime mortgages.\n\nWP: I Except, perhaps, as delivered by Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez?\n\nSC:\u00a0It makes the medicine go down a little more easily.\n\nI go back to - and this is in the movie, where it's being described to me what a synthetic CDO is - which is that you have CDO-A, and then you have CDO-B. And they both get pooled together as CDO-C, which is known as CDO squared, or a synthetic CDO. That's how it was explained to me.\n\nWhat's so funny is that I read the book, and then I almost immediately had to go back and reread portions of it again. It's dense material. What I came away from the movie with is that you don't really have to understand all of the minutiae, if you get the emotional arcs of these characters. It's almost like watching a foreign movie and looking up from the subtitles and still getting it.\n\nWP: Adam McKay gets it all?\n\nSC:\u00a0Oh, yeah. He understands it on a very deep level. We had financial advisers, we had people who knew this world inside and out whom we could ask questions of, all the way through. But Adam was just as adept at fielding questions as they were.\n\nRyan (Gosling) and I actually went to a tutoring session. What's tricky about this movie in particular is that Adam McKay likes to improvise, so unless you know a little bit about what you're saying, you can't improvise. You have to have a little bit of the language in your back pocket or you're kind of sunk. No. You can't learn this stuff phonetically.\n\nSteve Carrell, right, as Mark Baum in The Big Short\n\nSC: On the other hand, I have a cursory knowledge of it. Talking to (Steve Eisman), he could lose me in a matter of minutes. Ryan's character (Jared Vennett, based on hedge fund manager Greg Lippmann) points out that it is complicated for a reason: The whole world has been set up to put off lay people from understanding what's going on. If you feel dumb, there's a reason.\n\nI do remember Ryan saying, 'I'm jacked to the tits', which was not a scripted line. That just comes from the mind of Ryan Gosling. You have to put it in the movie. And, of course, you put it in the trailer. Most of the banter that my team had, almost all of that was improvised. The way Adam shot it was important, too. A lot of it was done with long lenses, so the camera could be in a corner where the actors couldn't see it or know what the camera was doing. There was a freedom.\n\nWP: You have to have a quick mind to improvise, especially with this source material. Yet Adam is known for what some might call dumb comedy.\n\nSC:\u00a0I guess I don't think of his movies as being dumb humor. I see them as being absurdist. Adam's satire is hidden under ridiculous characters sometimes dressed as '70s newspeople. There's a lot more going on in his movies than meets the eye.\n\nWP: With your dark Oscar-nominated role in Foxcatcher, you defied the stereotype that some people may have had of you. You smashed an expectation of who you should be.\n\nSC:\u00a0That's an interesting way to put it: an expectation of who you should be. More often than not, it's described as an expectation of who you are. I think that's true, but it wasn't something I did on purpose. You never know if it's going to work or if people are going to buy it.\n\nHe's a really confident guy, and not in an off-putting way. Someone who is comfortable in his own skin and will not back down and not feel intimidated in any situation. That's an interesting way to navigate life.\n\nRyan Gosling as Jared Vennett in The Big Short\n\nWP: Is it fair to describe your character as the film's moral center?\n\nSC:\u00a0That's hard for me to say. I think he's very conflicted about what's going on and the benefits that he stands to reap from these horrible things happening. I suppose you could say that. He definitely has a strong moral compass but is conflicted as well. It's not like he's not going to take the money.\n\nYou know what? Someone asked Adam in a Q&A the other night, 'Are we supposed to think that these guys are heroes?' I'm going to paraphrase him. Essentially he said, in the context of this world, yes. They're sort of as close to heroes as you get.\n\nBrad Pitt as Ben Rickert in The Big Short",

      "text": "When the King of Rock n' Roll Elvis Presley was just 23, he was in the midst of the biggest rise of his legendary music career.\n\nThe young crooner had hit the big time in the late 1950s and had taken emergency leave from a stint in the US army after learning his mother, Gladys, was gravely ill.\n\nElvis was unusually devoted to his parents Vernon and Gladys, who humbly raised their son in Memphis before he became a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nREAD MORE: The tragedy which tore apart River and Joaquin Phoenix\n\nREAD MORE: Just 18 months after this wedding snap, Sharon Tate was dead\n\nAs their only child after his twin was born still, Elvis was truly the apple of his mother's eye.\n\nThe mother-son duo were so close that Elvis even shared a bed with her until he was in his teens. \"She was the number-one girl in his life, and he was dedicating his career to her,\" a reporter for the Memphis Press Scimitar once wrote.\n\nDuring his long stretches away on tour or recording music, Elvis' mother had \"neglected\" her health. Reports at the time claimed she began drinking heavily and was diagnosed with serious liver problems.\n\nHowever Elvis biographer Sally Hoedel, who wrote Elvis: Destined to Die Young, said Gladys had underlying health issues that contributed to her early death.\n\n\"Gladys has always been painted as this woman whose son became famous, bought her a big house and she just struggled to deal with it all and essentially died of a broken heart,\" Hoedel wrote.\n\n\"But that's not how it works. I think Elvis and Vernon [Elvis' father] both knew who knew how sick she was before he left for the army.\"\n\nGladys' ill health meant the singer was allowed to return home on an emergency furlough from the army on August 12, 1958 to visit.\n\nJust two days later, Gladys died at age 46 in a Memphis hospital from a reported heart attack. Elvis was described as \"sobbing and crying hysterically\" in the hours and days following his beloved mother's death.\n\nShe was the number-one girl in his life, and he was dedicating his career to her\n\nOn the day of Gladys' death, Elvis and his father Vernon addressed the waiting press on the steps of their now-famous Graceland home.\n\nAn iconic photo of a grief-stricken Elvis was snapped as he sat next to his heartbroken father.\n\nFew could forget the look of devastation in the music legend's eyes as he grappled with the loss of his number one fan and supporter. The photo, even 64 years on, is still remembered as one of Elvis' toughest personal moments.\n\nThe moment was also memorably immortalised in film in Baz Luhrmann's 2022 movie Elvis.\n\nElvis' public display of grief was bittersweet for the Jailhouse Rock hitmaker. The black-and-white images of Elvis and Vernon were plastered across newspapers around the country.\n\nThe coverage softened the harsh critique of Elvis and his \"controversial\" music and dance moves in the press.\n\nThe AP reported that Elvis was in \"near hysteria\" at his mother's funeral on August 16.\n\nThe publication also shared Elvis' \"grief-stricken\" words at his mother's graveside. \"Goodbye, darling. We loved you,\" he said. \"Oh God, everything I have is gone. I lived my life for you. I loved you so much.\"\n\nFollowing Gladys' death, The Evening News reported the King of Rock and Roll had always put his parents' first following his meteoric rise to fame.\n\n\"Unlike so many sons, when fortune smiled, Elvis Presley thought first of his parents' welfare. He provided generously for them,\" the report read.\n\n\"It was gratifying to note he saw his mother just a few hours before she died, having arrived home on emergency leave from the armed forces.\"\n\nIt is said that Elvis never truly got over his mother's premature death \u2013 even until the day he died 19 years later to the exact day at age 42.\n\n\"It broke my heart,\" Elvis said before his own death in 1977. \"She was always my best girl.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nThe promise Elvis made to Priscilla's father before marriage",

      "text": "The pop-culture behemoth that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe shows no signs of slowing its momentum in 2023, with five releases planned throughout the year, including a new outing for Ant Man and the Wasp, as well as another ensemble effort with \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d sequel \u201cThe Marvels.\u201d Top of our list, though, is the return of the lovable rogues known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, led by Star Lord/Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). Last time out, the Guardians managed to purchase Knowhere, with the intention of turning into their headquarters and a safe haven for alien refugees. Details are sketchy, but the plot will reportedly involved the team having to embark on a risky mission to save one of their members. And probably the universe too. James Gunn directs (as he has the two previous \u201cGuardians\u201d movies). There are rumors that Rocket \u2014\u202fthe racoon bounty hunter \u2014 will have a love interest introduced: Lylla the otter.\n\nMarvel\u2019s superhero rivals DC, meanwhile, are pinning their hopes on a couple of major new releases including Jason Momoa reprising his titular role in \u201cAquaman and the Lost Kingdom,\u201d and this movie about the swiftest superhero alive. Given the controversies currently swirling around lead actor Ezra Miller, DC will be hoping the old clich\u00e9 about no publicity being bad publicity holds true and that the film isn\u2019t DOA at the box office. Argentinian director Andy Muschietti, who helmed the \u201cIt\u201d film series, has been tasked with running the show. Inspired by the comic book storyline \u201cFlashpoint,\u201d the movie sees Barry Allen/The Flash travel through time in an attempt to prevent his mother\u2019s murder. Time travel, as you\u2019d think the allegedly \u201chighly intelligent\u201d Allen would know, turns out to be a tricky affair, with a lot of unforeseen consequences. One of the good ones being that we get to see multiple versions of Batman, with both Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton reprising their versions of the Caped Crusader.\n\nYes, a movie about the iconic Mattel doll \u2014\u202fwhich has, over the years, become a symbol of society\u2019s unrealistic ideals for women\u2019s bodies \u2014 sounds like a terrible idea. But. This particular movie that sounds like a terrible idea is co-written by Noah Baumbach (\u201cMarriage Story\u201d) and Greta Gerwig (\u201cLady Bird\u201d), who also directs. And it stars two of Hollywood\u2019s brightest stars, Robbie and Gosling, as Barbie and Ken. Expect plenty of ironic humor, then. Suddenly, it starts to sound as though \u2014 despite the horribly cynical marketing scheme that undoubtedly got the film funded \u2014 this could be a lot of fun.\n\nIt\u2019s taken Nintendo a while to get over the disastrous 1993 film \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d Thirty years on, the Japanese video game giant has finally handed another license to Hollywood, this time for an animated adventure comedy with a stellar voice cast, based on its iconic games about two Italian brothers who are plumbers. Horvath and Jelenic\u2019s pedigree as creators of the often-brilliant \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d bodes well for the movie. Apparently, not even the actors were privy to the full plot, so the story remains unknown, but it\u2019s reasonable to expect it will involve Mario and Luigi having to rescue Princess Peach from some kind of labyrinth. May be worth seeing just to judge Chris Pratt\u2019s accent for yourself.\n\nThe first three instalments in the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d film series have all excelled at giving audiences adrenaline-rush fight scenes with minimal (by today\u2019s standards) special effects, so we\u2019re excited to see what new surprises Stahelski has in store in number four. Reeves returns as the less-than-talkative legendary assassin desperately trying to retire and be left in peace. But the shadowy organization that oversees the contract killers our anti-hero was once the best of won\u2019t let him. Now, Wick believes he has found a way to defeat the High Table once and for all. But the path to his escape has many obstacles, including a well-connected new enemy, and old friends now turned foes.\n\nAnticipation is sky-high for this sequel to 2018\u2019s animated hit \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\u201d Its predecessor was a superb, thrilling, funny journey into alternate universes that introduced us to a host of different incarnations of Spider-Man, including, of course, Brooklyn teen Miles Morales. In this follow-up, Morales and his love interest Gwen Stacy (the Spider-Woman of her universe) team up to take on a new foe who threatens the lives of all Spider-People. They are helped by the Spider-Force team, who include a British punk version of Spider-Man, and a pregnant version of Spider-Woman.\n\n\u2018Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u2019\n\nOkay, so Steven Spielberg isn\u2019t directing it, and George Lucas didn\u2019t write it, but it\u2019s still Indiana Jones (and the pair are both executive producers). The film is set in 1969 and finds an ageing Dr. Jones searching for the titular object alongside his goddaughter Helena (Waller-Bridge). Jones is also wary of the former Nazis working with the US government to take on the Soviet Union in the space race, particularly the sinister Jurgen Voller (Mikkelsen).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic played havoc with its schedule, but the seventh instalment of the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise is finally with us. Cruise is now 60, but continues to pull off many of his own stunts including the spectacular motorcycle-dismount-into-parachute-jump seen in the trailer. Esai Morales is the as-yet-unnamed main villain of the piece. Details have been kept under wraps, but it\u2019s a fair bet Cruise\u2019s special agent Ethan Hunt and his IMF team will still have members of The Syndicate/The Apostles to deal with, despite defeating their leader, and we know that Vanessa Kirby is returning as arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis.\n\nFrank Herbert\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d novels were long considered \u2018un-filmable,\u2019 but Villeneuve disproved that theory with 2021\u2019s \u201cPart One,\u201d marrying Herbert\u2019s vision with his own to create a superb sci-fi epic. Part two will see Chalamet\u2019s Paul Atreides seek revenge against those who wiped out his family, with some help from the Chani and his new allies, the Fremen. Along the way, he must somehow prevent the nightmarish future that he has foreseen.\n\n\u2018The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u2019\n\nJust over a decade ago, the first \u201cHunger Games\u201d film propelled Jennifer Lawrence into mainstream stardom and cemented Suzanne Collins\u2019 novels as bona-fide cultural phenomena. \u201cThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d takes us back into that dystopian universe, but serves as a prequel to the four films released so far. Blyth stars as a young Coriolanus Snow (the future president of Panem and villain of the previous movies), who is serving as a mentor for the upcoming Hunger Games and forms a bond with the tribute from District 12: Lucy Gray Baird. Expect revelations about what happened to turn Snow into the monster he would become.",

      "tags": [],
      "text": "\u201cThe journey\u2019s the destination, sweetheart,\u201d says Curtis, the slick gambler in Mississippi Grind, played by Ryan Reynolds with the air of a man who almost believes his winning streak is unbreakable. That statement encapsulates both the beauty and the limitations of this latest film by writer-director team Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, a meandering road movie enriched by its fine-grained study of character and milieu, but somewhat lethargic and momentum-deprived in terms of narrative. Still, admirers of the filmmakers\u2019 previous work will find the rambling ride intoxicating, not least for its affectionate tip of the hat to Robert Altman\u2018s California Split.\n\nWhile their film is played less for comedy,\u00a0Boden and Fleck borrow their central character dynamic from Altman\u2019s 1974 classic. They pair a slick, savvy pro with a down-on-his-luck poker player who tags along in his new friend\u2019s seemingly magical wake, from racetracks to floating card games to casinos. But Mississippi Grind acknowledges a debt to a whole spate of films from that decade \u2014 loose-limbed portraits of free spirits, drifters, disarming reprobates and likeable losers.\n\nSee more The Scene at Sundance Film Festival 2015\n\nThe film that put the writer-directors on the Sundance map in 2006, Half Nelson, was only in part about the drug addiction of its main character, a floundering inner-city middle-school teacher played by Ryan Gosling in what is still among his best performances. In the same way, this new film is less a direct examination of the compulsion of gambling, with its rollercoaster highs and lows, than it is a soulful reflection on the desperation of men who buy into the unreliable dream that a windfall will satisfy their inarticulate longings.\n\nThat subdued air of melancholy, along with a gentle strain of humor, runs through the film much like the river that shapes the two men\u2019s journey as they head from Iowa, via multiple gambling stops, to a $25,000-stake high-roller poker game in New Orleans. And while the tone is relaxed and playful, the underlying sadness comes through, perhaps most poignantly in Reynolds\u2019 Curtis, in moments when his effortless charisma and unflappable confidence don\u2019t quite hide the needling glimmers of self-frustration or loneliness. It\u2019s hard to remember this ridiculously handsome actor\u2019s talents being put to more effective use.\n\nMore from THR at Sundance:\n\nOpposite him, Ben Mendelsohn plays Gerry, a haggard-looking schlub with an estranged ex-wife (Robin Weigert) and daughter behind him and a whole mountain of gambling debts creeping up on him \u2014 as a local loan shark (Alfre Woodard) reminds him with icy-cool seriousness. Weigert and Woodard have just one absolutely terrific scene apiece, but they nail a complete history of affection turned to dwindling forbearance for Gerry\u2019s failings. The movie\u2019s chief pleasure is watching Mendelsohn in a wonderful role that\u2019s both shifty and sincere, taking maximum advantage of the Australian actor\u2019s hangdog appeal and sauntering physicality.\n\nSince Gerry\u2019s day job as a third-rate real estate broker is never going to get him out of the hole, he hitches his wagon to Curtis after they meet during a card game and bond over bourbon. Breezing into town on the back of a picture-book rainbow, Curtis obviously enjoys spreading his lucky-charm largesse, even if he makes intermittent moves to offload Gerry as a bad risk.\n\nCurtis claims that he doesn\u2019t care about winning and just likes to play, never succumbing to Gerry\u2019s fatal flaw of not knowing when to quit. But despite the socially skilled, in-control exterior he presents, Curtis is just as stuck on the seesaw of chance. A more wistful side of him emerges in lovely interludes with Simone (Sienna Miller), a sexy St. Louis bar hostess and his sometime girlfriend; and his smoky-voiced mother (Marshall Chapman), a been-around-the-block singer. No less tender are the scenes of shy flirtation between Gerry and Simone\u2019s guileless colleague Vanessa (Analeigh Tipton).\n\nThe film casts a spell moment to moment, although its pacing demands considerable patience and its cumulative effect doesn\u2019t deliver in conventional terms. Gerry\u2019s quest to clear his debts, start fresh and do something nice for his daughter never really becomes a driving force, and nor does the arrival in New Orleans provide a tangible payoff. (However, buffs will enjoy a thuggish appearance there by James Toback, whose history with the genre includes his semi-autobiographical script for the original 1974 The Gambler.) It ends instead, perhaps inevitably, on a note of ambiguity, in which each man may change direction or more likely continue down the same path.\n\nSee more Exclusive Photos of Kristen Wiig, Jack Black, Jason Segel and More\n\nTrue to the storytelling principles that have shaped their movies, Boden and Fleck are interested mainly in observing the ways in which Curtis and Gerry pull together and draw apart, deceiving one another out of self-interest and then opening up out of a desire to connect to a kindred spirit. The filmmakers\u2019 reluctance to over-explain character motivations has mostly kept their films out of the mainstream and will continue to do so here, but there\u2019s no shortage of impressions that resonate. And the performances of both Reynolds and Mendelsohn are fortified with deep feeling, working in admirable tandem.\n\nThe polished movie\u2019s limberness to a large degree comes from its invigorating use of flavorful blues and honkytonk tunes, including vocal, guitar and piano pieces. That music seems part of the fabric of the cities through which Curtis and Gerry pass, where cinematographer Andrij Parekh evocatively captures the dingy barrooms and pool halls, the racetracks, seedy hotels, faded storefronts, and even the ritzier establishments, much of it having the appearance of places frozen in time. Those settings make an apt backdrop for two guys caught in a loop of hope, elation and crushing disappointment.",

      "text": "Brad Pitt deserves an Oscar for his great movie-star performance in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nI first paid serious attention to Margot Robbie when she was subject to one of the weirdest celebrity profiles I've ever read.\n\nThe year was 2016, the magazine was Vanity Fair, and Robbie was, according to reporter Rich Cohen, \"26 and beautiful, not in that otherworldly, catwalk way but in a minor knock-around key, a blue mood, a slow dance\u2026 She is blonde but dark at the roots. She is tall but only with the help of certain shoes\".\n\nHaving established a working knowledge of how hair dye and high heels function, Cohen went on to refer to Robbie as having a \"lost kind of purity\" and coming from a land where \"dingo really will eat your baby\".\n\nIt read like it was Cohen's first time hearing of Australia and perhaps talking to a woman. Robbie said at the time that it had been a \"really odd interview\",\u00a0but even she seemed surprised at how it came out. How pleasing, then, that her most recent interaction with an American glossy seems to have gone much more smoothly.\n\nMargot Robbie is on the cover of the July edition of Vogue magazine.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Margot Robbie honours Sharon Tate with her Cannes hair style\n\n*\u00a0What she wore: Get a little of Margot Robbie's cool, contemporary style\n\n*\u00a0With Brad and Leo, Quentin Tarantino debuts a fairytale in Cannes\n\nRobbie is on the cover of July's Vogue\u00a0and, while the story is good, it's the shoot that has stuck in my mind. Shot by Inez & Vinoodh and with makeup from Patti Dubroff, the shoot sees Robbie shapeshift through eras and moods \u2013\u00a0she wears Chanel sequins, Versace silk\u00a0and three-piece suit. It's good as hell. My favourite shot isn't even the cover itself. Instead, I keep coming back to a picture of Robbie in stripes and faux fur, with the most beautiful blue eye makeup since The Love Witch. She looks like Anita Pallenberg.\n\nMargot Robbie paid homage to Sharon Tait, the actress she plays in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, while in Cannes for the film's world premiere last month.\n\nAnd while I'm not looking to recreate that fringe, I am very keen to get amongst Robbie's '60s eye. I think a combo of Urban Decay Evidence ($36)\u00a0and Surratt Artistique Eyeshadow in Minuit ($34)\u00a0would work, with plenty of mascara and Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Gel Eye Crayon ($36). Dubroff didn't give Robbie a lot of blush or contour \u2013\u00a0the eyes are the focus here \u2013\u00a0but I do also enjoy the tawny nude lip. Bobbi Brown Crushed Lip Colour in Bare\u00a0($54)\u00a0would be a strong option.\n\nItems to help you channel your inner-Margot, clockwise from top left, Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Gel Eye Crayon ($36), Bobbi Brown Crushed Lip Colour in Bare ($54), Surratt Artistique Eyeshadow in Minuit ($34) and Urban Decay Evidence ($36).\n\nTragically, none of the above comes with Robbie's bone-structure, but we have to work with what we've got. Makeup is a lot less invasive than cheek implants.",

      "text": "If Melbourne schoolgirl\u00a0Angourie\u00a0Rice ever gets around to writing a \"what I did on my holidays\" story about how she spent July 2017, it might read a little like this: Went to Los Angeles for the premiere of\u00a0Spider-Man: Homecoming, in which I had a small role. Did press for\u00a0The Beguiled, the film that won Sofia\u00a0Coppola\u00a0best director at Cannes and in which I have a bigger role. Headed to Canada to shoot\u00a0Every Day, in which I have a starring role.\n\n\"I'm really excited for it,\" the 16-year-old actor says of this last project\u00a0before jetting off to film the adaptation of David\u00a0Levithan's\u00a0YA novel (which you might describe as something of a teenage take on\u00a0Groundhog Day).\n\n\"I read the book before I knew about the film, I just picked it up at the library, thought this looks cool, and I loved it. So when the film came through I thought, 'Hey I've read this, this is great'.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Movie Review: Spider-Man: Homecoming - a refreshing Marvel\n\n*\u00a0Spider-Man and the shift towards wise-cracking\u00a0superheroes\n\n*\u00a0\u200bTom Holland reveals what he wore underneath his Spider-Man: Homecoming suit\n\nEvery Day\u00a0is Rice's seventh feature film in the four-and-a-bit years since her debut, the Perth-set apocalyptic drama\u00a0These Final Hours\u00a0(shot in 2013 and released the following year). It's a remarkable run that has seen her leap from the low-budget world of indie filmmaking in Australia to the biggest of big-budget filmmaking in Hollywood, seemingly without breaking a sweat.\n\nOf the two extremes, she says, \"The core of the experience is very much the same. You still have to do all the same work, and all the same jobs get done. It's just that on a typical day of\u00a0These Final Hours\u00a0there might be a couple of trucks and about 50 people, and on\u00a0Spider-Man\u00a0there were at least 50 trucks and over 1000 people.\n\nAngourie Rice has been described by her agent as  \"a force of nature\".\n\n\"The other huge difference working in the Marvel Universe is the secrecy.\u00a0Nobody is allowed to tell anyone anything, and you can't take or post any pictures without permission.\"\n\nFor your average teenager, being denied the opportunity to share every micro-experience as it happens on\u00a0Instagram\u00a0or\u00a0Snapchat\u00a0might constitute a torture of the most ungodly kind. But while she comes across as level-headed, likeable and thoroughly pleasant, in some respects\u00a0Angourie\u00a0Rice is far from your average teenager.\n\n\"She is wise beyond her years,\" says Bonnie Elliott, the director of photography on\u00a0These Final Hours. \"I've never met such a poised young person.\"\n\nAfter screening at the New Zealand International Film Festival, The Beguiled is now returning to select Kiwi cinemas.\n\n\"Angourie\u00a0is a force of nature,\" says her Australian agent, Catherine Poulton. \"She is remarkably composed, with a maturity beyond her years that really translates into her work on the screen.\"\n\nThat quality was blindingly apparent in\u00a0The Nice Guys\u00a0(2016), Shane Black's raucous neo-noir thriller starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe; as the straight-talking 14-year-old daughter of Gosling's slightly useless private eye, she practically walked away with every scene she was in.\n\nThose who know Rice say it is impossible to overstate the influence of her parents, Kate and Jeremy, on\u00a0her character and her career. Both are in the game, so to speak \u2013 Kate a former\u00a0actor\u00a0turned writer (she hated\u00a0auditions,\u00a0which frequently left her in tears), Jeremy a theatre director.\n\nThe Beguiled stars, from left, Elle Fanning as Alicia, Nicole Kidman as Miss Martha, Kirsten Dunst as Edwina, Angourie Rice as Jane, Oona Laurence as Amy, Emma Howard as Emily and Addison Riecke as Marie.\n\nIn a\u00a0real sense,\u00a0Angourie\u00a0was born into the family business. Kate was in the middle of a production when she discovered she was pregnant.\u00a0Angourie\u00a0spent a good chunk of her crawling years on the floor of a rehearsal space. Her parents got their first inkling that she might have an interest in a rehearsal room in Darwin, when she was about four years old, preparing to mount\u00a0Petunia Takes Tea, \"a really strange comic play about a girl who chops off her legs\", Kate says. \"I remember her quoting lines I was rehearsing \u2013 a fairly inappropriate scene, actually \u2013 and that's when we realised she was into it.\"\n\nShe did some commercials in Perth, where the family then lived, and her first short film, aged about six. \"It was a dramatic story, about parents who were estranged,\" Kate says.\n\n\"I was so little, and my younger sister played the younger version of me,\"\u00a0Angourie\u00a0says. \"She was so cute, she was adorable.\" (Kalliope, 13, has retired from acting, preferring to focus on gymnastics.)\n\nRyan Gosling might have been one of the headliners, but Angourie Rice stole the show in The Nice Guys.\n\nAngourie\u00a0recently posted on her blog the text of a speech she gave in a school debate. Her topic was the way women are represented in film. It was well researched and argued, and clearly a subject close to her heart.\n\n\"It informs my choices a lot,\" she says. \"I don't want to play the girlfriend, who's there because she's the girlfriend. And. That's. Her. Job. I want to play women and girls who are active and strong and who have a character arc and make decisions and have a rich background. And I think\u00a0The Beguiled\u00a0was one of those.\"\n\nThe Nice Guys was one of the most crowdpleasing movies of 2016.\n\nCoppola's\u00a0film, a remake of a 1971 Don Siegel-Clint Eastwood collaboration, is a southern gothic western in which an injured Union soldier (Colin Farrell) finds refuge in a girls' school in the south. But as he heals, his presence excites the passions of, and ultimately stirs rivalries between, the young students (Elle\u00a0Fanning and Rice are the eldest of the five girls), their teacher (Kirsten\u00a0Dunst) and even the headmistress (Nicole Kidman). Naturally, things do not end well.\n\nRice knows\u00a0Coppola\u00a0isn't to everyone's taste \u2013 \"she's subtle, but some people just think she's boring\" \u2013 but she was desperate to work with her. She initially tried out for the role of 12-year-old Amy, \"but they told me I was too old for it\". So she read for, and landed, the role of the piano-and violin-playing Jane instead.\n\nShe even learnt a couple of Civil War-era songs for the violin but there wasn't time to film them (because she is still technically a minor in the US, her hours on set are strictly monitored). \"It looks like I'm playing though,\" she says. \"It's a piece I chose.\"\n\nIt sounds like a charmed life, perhaps, but Rice is slowly accepting the fact she can't do everything. She has dropped out of the school orchestra, and she has dropped to four subjects for her VCE (English, Biology, German and Studio Arts). Her school \u2013 she prefers not to have it named in print \u2013 has been amazingly supportive, she says. She's pretty sure she wants to go to university, but with her being in the country only about 60 per cent of last year, flexibility is essential on all sides.\n\nSocially, she admits, it can be challenging. \"I go away and I have to put my friendships on hold, and then when I come back it's different, it's changed, because that's how high school works \u2013 people grow and they move on.\n\n\"Sometimes it's really difficult but I have friends who have always been there for me, since before year 7, before I did any huge films. I have my friends who like me because I'm me, and not because I'm in films, and that's really important to me. They tell me, 'You look terrible, don't wear that', or 'That joke wasn't funny', and that's really important, they keep me grounded.\"\n\nIt's inevitable, perhaps, that some key milestones in the life of a teenager might fall by the wayside. But then, showbiz does offer its consolations.\n\n\"I went to my first school dance on the set of\u00a0Spider-Man,\" she tells me excitedly. \"The funny thing is, it wasn't actually real. I didn't choose my dress, or my date, or anything about it.\n\n\"I just showed up for work.\"\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (M) is now screening, The Beguiled (M) will makes its\u00a0New Zealand debut as part of the New Zealand International Film Festival.",

      "text": "See how Ford and Pursuit Systems created an Endura camera vehicle for filming fast-car action.\n\nOPINION: There are\u00a0special kinds of car-shorthand often used in television\u00a0and movies: tropes that exist to tell a story more clearly or enhance action set-pieces.\n\nLots of them\u00a0we don't have a problem with.\n\nIt's okay if a modern car suddenly seems to be devoid of traction and/or stability control so that it can do skids (or if a front-drive car suddenly develops power-oversteer ability, like the Toyota Prius in The Other Guys from 2010).\n\nStability control is seldom active in movie car chases. Fine with us.\n\nIt's okay that lead characters suddenly become accomplished stunt\u00a0drivers when the action kicks off, J-turning and jumping cars like anybody can do it (when in fact hardly anybody can do either of those things).\n\nREAD MORE\n\n* Are you a car nerd?\n\n* Movie hero cars you never noticed\n\n* Hollywood cars that aren't what they seem\n\nNor do we mind if cars aren't absolutely period-correct.\n\nIt's okay that the model of Audi Quattro shown in Ashes to Ashes (2008) wasn't actually available at the time the show is set, in 1981. We don't care. It suits the character of Gene Hunt and we want to see it.\n\nTell Gene Hunt from Ashes to Ashes that his Audi is the wrong model and he might punch you in the face.\n\nNope, the stuff that makes car-people crazy happens when there are instances of automotive unreality that are the result not of making things more interesting, but because of laziness and/or lack of knowledge - which then becomes an insult to the car-literate viewer.\n\nHere are five we loathe the most.\n\nChange down to go faster\n\nIt's a drag race: change down a gear and you'll go faster.\n\nThe notion that a car goes faster if\u00a0you change down a gear - on flat road at full throttle, mind - has been a long-running trope in movies that has become positively common in the age of\u00a0Fast and Furious movies.\n\nYes, we get it: showing somebody quickly chopping down a gear is an easy way to suggest that they've done something dramatic to gain a burst of speed.\n\nIt's\u00a0commonly used in scenes where the lead in a drag race can change several times over a quarter mile. Seriously?\n\nThe same car becomes different\n\nAll Dodge vehicles look the same... to some people.\n\nThere are lots of reasons why a car might suddenly change specification through the course of a TV show or movie. None of them have anything to do with the story.\n\nMaybe reshoots had to be done and the original just wasn't available. Maybe a character should be driving something expensive but there's a scene where the car gets damaged or destroyed, so something much cheaper is used when crunch-time comes.\n\nThis is all insulting to the car-savvy viewer because these changes are made with the assumption that nobody will notice.\n\nF&F is a lead offender again: for example, in Fast Five (2011)\u00a0a couple of\u00a0Dodge Chargers change from the very latest model to a previous-generation shape when the time comes for the big stunt set-piece.\n\nOr in the The Age of Adaline (2015), a romantic drama about a woman who stops getting older at the age of 29, a Jeep Grand Cherokee driven throughout the story\u00a0by Ellis Jones suddenly gets several generations older in a night-time scene late in the movie.\n\n\u200bIn New Zealand's own Filthy Rich (2016), did anybody notice that the Aston Martin driven by lead character Brady is sometimes a two-door DB9 and other times a four-door Vanquish?\u00a0Or maybe she just really likes Aston Martins in that colour.\n\nIn the past, everybody had brand new cars\n\nCars in period movies look distractingly well cared for. Almost as if they are valuable classics.\n\nStreet scenes showing contemporary cars are a great way to anchor a period-piece in a very specific time frame.\n\nHowever, 99 per cent of the time the same fatal mistake is made: all the cars you see would have been brand-new at the time and more often than not they're in concours condition. When in fact\u00a0those \"new\" cars should be peppered with a\u00a0mixture of vehicles five, 10, even 20 and 30 years old. And they should look like people actually drive them.\n\nAfter all, when you look out your window you don't see a street full of brand-new, freshly groomed vehicles. Unless you live across from a car dealership.\n\nCars go as fast backwards as they do forwards\n\nQuick flick in the Mustang. Now let's drive in reverse at 150kmh.\n\nSometimes it's done for comic effect, which is fine.\n\nBut just as often, cars are shown to be just as fast backwards as they are forwards during\u00a0serious action scenes.\n\nThat's just not possible - if for no reason other than gearing. Which makes the bit in Drive (2011) where our nameless lead (Ryan Gosling) handbrake-turns his Mustang in front of a Chrysler 300 and then drives ahead - but backwards - at the same speed utterly ridiculous.\n\nYou can actually hear gearchanges, too. Just saying.\n\nWe like it when movie car chases keep it real. Like Bullitt.\n\nThat brings us to the tricky issue of having the correct engine sound. We get that capturing engine and exhaust noise is a tricky business and that most sound people would sooner just reply on the big bank of generic car sounds they have on the hard drive at the studio. That's why so many small hatchbacks sound like\u00a0V8s in the movies.\n\nBullitt\u00a0(1968) sounded pretty grunty. But the gold standard for car sounds\u00a0is arguably\u00a0Ronin (1998). Director John Frankenheimer had\u00a0every car that appeared in an action scene recorded at a racetrack so that the engine noises would be 100 per cent accurate. That's attention to detail.\n\nThe Tesla Model S doesn't have a petrol engine. Just saying.\n\nThe low point in contemporary film is the otherwise-excellent Thoroughbreds (2017). In one of the final scenes, lead character Lily rolls up to a restaurant valet-parking area in her new Tesla Model S - complete\u00a0with crisp petrol-engine soundtrack.\n\nYou don't have to be a car person to know that's a fail.",

      "text": "Regardless of what you think about whether or not they should have remade Goodbye Pork Pie, there's no question that, like the original, Pork Pie is a \"very Kiwi\" film.\n\nAnd like the movie he stars in,\u00a0Pork Pie lead Dean O'Gorman, a veteran of screens both big and small for more than a quarter-century now, has had a \"very Kiwi\" career path as an actor.\n\nHe ticks the big three boxes \u2013\u00a0Shortland Street, Peter Jackson blockbuster (The Hobbit movies), TV drama scripted by James Griffin and Rachel Lang (The Almighty Johnsons).\n\nHe also had roles on Hercules and Xena: Warrior Princess, something else that was practically mandatory for a Kiwi actor of his generation. (Apologies\u00a0if that phrase makes Dean\u00a0sound old but hey, the guy's in his 40s\u00a0now)\n\nAshleigh Cummings, James Rolleston and Dean O'Gorman are the stars of Pork Pie.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0Unwell Geoff Murphy pulls through for Wellington Pork Pie screening\n\n*\u00a0Matt Murphy: Pork Pie director looks back on his life of Pie\n\n*\u00a0Pork Pie celebrates release with nationwide road trip\n\n*\u00a0Movie Review: Pork Pie - an update that lacks the original's spice\n\n*\u00a0Minis and movie stars at the Pork Pie premiere\n\nAnd like\u00a0Pork Pie co-star James Rolleston, O'Gorman even\u00a0got his start as a professional actor fresh out of school. Admittedly, that's maybe not your typical Kiwi actor's start, but to me it still seems like a very Kiwi way to get going in the business.\n\nRevamped Pork Pie set to open early February, so we sat in the iconic yellow mini for a few laps with the producer Tom Hearn and the writer Mat Murphy.\n\nI don't think it's a spoiler to mention this, given it happens within the first few minutes of the movie, but O'Gorman's\u00a0first line in Pork Pie \u2013\u00a0before we even see him on screen in fact \u2013\u00a0is a fart.\n\nI mean, come on \u2013\u00a0how Kiwi is that?\n\nAsked if he knows whether this\u00a0flatulent first impression is a cinematic first or not, O'Gorman disavows all knowledge.\n\n\"It wasn't my fart though. I don't know whose it was,\" he riffs. \"It was very windy that day though.\"\n\nIt wasn't quite a year ago that O'Gorman travelled the length and breadth of New Zealand to make Pork Pie, and now he's doing the same thing again to promote it.\n\nWhen I talk to him, the 40-year-old has a full day of publicity engagements, most of them alongside Pork Pie co-stars Rolleston and Ashleigh Cummings.\n\nWe've just finished a Facebook Live chat for the Stuff website, taking questions from all and sundry online, and there's a couple in particular that keep coming up again and again.\n\nThe first, and perhaps the most vociferously expressed, is a plain-and-simple \u2013\u00a0\"why?\" Why remake a film that is not only considered a Kiwi classic, but also very much a product of its time?\n\nWhat, to put it bluntly, is the point of Pork Pie?\n\nQuite rightly, O'Gorman can't really answer this, replying that it's more a question for the film's creator, writer-director Matt Murphy, son of Goodbye Pork Pie writer-director Geoff Murphy.\n\nHe does make an interesting point on the subject however.\n\n\"You know, regardless of what people think about remaking or rebooting\u00a0an old New Zealand classic, I think\u00a0it ultimately says good things about our industry in that we have enough film now, and we've created enough of a history, to be able to go back to do a remake, you know what I mean?\n\nDean O'Gorman earned rave reviews for his performance as Kirk Douglas in 2015's Trumbo.\n\n\"People have their opinion and stuff, but for me the main positive thing is that there's work being generated, and it's our own local content that we're exploring. We're now starting to remake our own stuff. Which I think is a sign of a growing and healthy industry.\"\n\nIt's a point well made, but as an actor, was there any trepidation in taking on a project with such a weight of Kiwi cinematic history behind it \u2013\u00a0and one that would inevitably draw comparison with its source material?\n\n\"No, no more than doing any film, and thinking, 'God, I hope this film works',\" says O'Gorman.\n\n\"I mean, this has the name that New Zealanders recognise, so I guess maybe there might be more attention than if it was just a film that people hadn't heard of, but essentially you're putting yourself up there to be judged, whether it's for a film that people are comparing to another film, or if it's just a film based on its own merits.\n\n\"You always stand to be judged by people and that's just something as an actor that you have to get used to.\"\n\nFor O'Gorman at least, the appeal of Pork Pie had nothing to do with its history and everything to do with three simple questions \u2013\u00a0questions the actor asks himself before taking on any new job.\n\n\"Do I like the script?\u00a0Do I want to work with these people? And\u00a0will it be a fun job? Those are my criteria,\" he says.\n\n\"And outside of that \u2013\u00a0you know, 'will it be liked?'\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you can't really ask yourself that question\u00a0because, (a)\u00a0you don't know\u00a0and, (b)\u00a0I think trying to be liked can be quite detrimental to the creative process sometimes.\n\n\"Because if you're asking yourself, 'What do I need to do to be liked?', you're asking yourself, 'what do people want to see?' \u2013\u00a0and I don't know what people want to see. I just do what I do, and hopefully it resonates with people, you know?\"\n\nPork Pie (M) opens in New Zealand cinemas on February 2.",

With the extra time on hand, there's nothing better than picking out a book to escape into.\n\nIf summer is about getting away from it all, then the summer beach read is about helping take you there. The perfect beach read is an easy page-turner that still has substance. Vacation is the perfect time to contemplate, after all.\n\nCulled largely from the ranks of Amazon's best-selling books, these 13 recommended beach reads will have you hooked. The picks are all available for purchase through Amazon, and all boast four-star ratings or higher on the site. Most were newly published within the past year, and all are available in hardcover and for the Kindle e-reader. (Check out these waterproof Kindle e-readers to make these summer beach reads truly beach-safe.)\n\nLooking for the perfect complement -- and companion -- to your summer vacation? Read on to find out what to read. Listed prices are current as of publication.\n\nThis Reese's Book Club pick, written by Lucy Foley, is a murder mystery set at a wedding on an island off the coast of Ireland. The book is filled with intrigue and revealed secrets. You'll meet the bride, the groom, the plus one, the best man, the wedding planner, the bridesmaid and more, but don't get too attached -- before you know it, one of them will turn up dead in \"The Guest List.\"\n\nMonths before the latest tale from Laura Dave (\"The Divorce Party\") was published, Reese Witherspoon and her production company snapped up the rights, and Julia Roberts signed on to star in its series adaptation for Apple TV+. So, yes, \"The Last Thing He Told Me\" has juice. It's the story of a woman, her teen step-daughter -- and a husband who goes missing. Vogue called the novel \"light and bright, despite its edgy plot.\"\n\n\"The Last Thing He Told Me: A Novel\" (Kindle Edition), $14\n\n\"The Last Thing He Told Me: A Novel\" (Hardcover), $16\n\nGlennon Doyle's \"Untamed\" still holds strong as a bestseller since its release in March 2020. Her No. 1 New York Times bestselling memoir has had celebrities from Reese Witherspoon to Oprah Winfrey raving, with millions of copies sold. This emotional page-turner tells the empowering story of Doyle's self-discovery. Find out what happens when she leaves discontentment behind in favor of living her truth.\n\nIs there a genre that's more escapist than sci-fi? If you're looking for an out-of-this-world trip this summer,  then \"Project Hail Mary\" may be your ticket. The new novel by Andy Weir, best known for \"The Martian,\" is about a man who wakes up on a spaceship with no idea why he's there, or who he is. Fortunately for humankind, he comes to learn he's not exactly unqualified for his station (he's an astronaut) or his mission (to save the Earth). Like other books in this rundown, \"Project Hail Mary\" is bound for Hollywood: Ryan Gosling is set to star in the big-screen version.\n\nThis new novel by Tia Williams (\"The Accidental Diva\") seems custom-made for beach readers. \"Seven Days in June\" is set not only in the summer, natch, but also the world of books. The tale of two authors reconnecting after a long-ago, teenage fling was hailed as \"[o]ne of the most anticipated romance novels of the summer\" by Oprah Daily.\n\n\"Malibu Rising\" is the latest novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid. Reid previously offered up one of 2019's best beach reads in \"Daisy Jones & the Six,\" a faux oral history of a faux 1970s music supergroup. This time out, Reid spins a story that's set primarily in 1983, and concerns a Southern California family, a house party -- and a raging wildfire. Praised Publishers Weekly: \"This page-turning indulgence hits the spot.\"\n\nThis new novel by Steven Rowley (\"Lily and the Octopus\") was named one of the Washington Post's \"[f]eel-good books to brighten your summer.\" In it, Patrick, known to his young niece and nephew as Gay Uncle Patrick, or GUP, unexpectedly becomes the caretaker to the two tykes. \"Rowley's depth and humor will warm even the most jaded hearts,\" the Post judged.\n\nIn \"one of 2021's must-read novels,\" per Bustle, author Nghi Vo (\"The Empress of Salt and Fortune\") reimagines \"The Great Gatsby\" from the perspective of Jordan Baker. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, Jordan is a white southerner who is Nick Carroway's love interest. In \"The Chosen and the Beautiful,\" she's a queer Vietnamese adoptee. \"Did we mention the book also mixes in magical realism?\" USA Today asked. (USA Today did -- and the book does.)\n\n\"The Chosen and the Beautiful\" (Kindle Edition)\n\n\"The Chosen and the Beautiful\" (Hardcover)\n\nThis debut novel by Zakiya Dalila Harris is generating tons of buzz. An Amazon editors' pick as a Best Book of June 2021, \"The Other Black Girl\" draws from Harris' former workaday life at a top publishing house. Billed as a thriller, the novel tells the story of Nella, a 26-year-old editorial assistant at (wait for it) a top publishing house. Nella is the only Black staffer in the otherwise all-white team until Hazel comes on board -- and complications ensue. \"Harris's writing propels you forward through the story,\" the New York Times said.\n\nThe first non-fiction read in this rundown, \"The Ugly Cry\" is Danielle Henderson's story of growing up, as the book's\u00a0publisher puts it, \"Black, weird, and overwhelmingly uncool in a mostly white neighborhood in upstate New York.\" Henderson, who was raised by her grandmother, is a TV writer (\"Maniac\") and podcaster (\"I Saw What You Did\"). Her memoir is, the Associated Press declared, \"powerful and energetic.\"\n\nAuthor Emily Henry literally wrote the book on beach reads -- or, one of them at least: Her 2020 entry, \"Beach Read,\" was a New York Times bestseller. The novelist returns this summer with \"People We Meet on Vacation,\" about two longtime friends, Alex and Poppy, who resume their once-annual ritual of summering together. The Wall Street Journal called out Henry's \"laugh-out-loud funny\" dialogue.\n\nNo, true-crime tales are not for streaming binges\u00a0only. \"Tiger Girl and the Candy Kid\" is a tome by veteran author Glenn Stout about Jazz Age baddies Margaret and Richard Whittemore, aka the \"original gangster couple\" of the book's subtitle. Stout's work is one of the New York Times' picks for best new true-crime books to read for summer 2021. \"Stout has done more than simply chronicle the couple's crimes,\" Tina Jordan wrote for the Times. \"He has tried to understand what motivated the Whittemores.\"\n\nA classic beach-reading experience demands a classic beach read -- or two. Here's the first pick from this bucket: Kevin Kwan's mammoth 2013 hit, \"Crazy Rich Asians.\" Whether you're re-reading the novel for the 100th time, or reading it for the first time (after seeing the hit movie for the 100th time), you'll be swept into the craziness that is the romance of Rachel Chu and Nick Young.\n\nThis is our second pick for a classic beach read. Jacqueline Susann's passionate, and passionately written, \"Valley of the Dolls\" was first published in 1966. Set in the post-World War II New York City, it's a tale of three young women with big dreams, and occasionally big drug problems. Summed up Nancy Bachrach once\u00a0for NPR, \"'Valley of the Dolls' is a zipper-ripper that has been called trashy, tawdry, glitzy, lusty, sordid and seamy -- and that's just the beginning of its appeal.\"\n\n* Where to buy face masks online after CDC updates COVID Delta variant guidelines\n\n* 8 coffee table options that look cool in any room\n\n* The best-selling Nintendo Switch games right now\n\n* What is Roku?

      "text": "It took quite a while for Ridley Scott\u2019s 1982 sci-fi film Blade Runner to attain classic status, and the long-in-the-works sequel could have an equally tough time reaching a wide audience, at least at first. Directed by master stylist Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival), Blade Runner 2049 is moody, methodical and meticulous, with stunning visuals, strong performances and a sci-fi story that\u2019s more ponderous than thrilling. Anyone looking for an action-packed sci-fi blockbuster will instead find a slow rumination on what it means to be human\u2014just as audiences did back in 1982.\n\nSet 30 years after the events of the original movie, 2049 stars Ryan Gosling as an LAPD detective known as K, a so-called blade runner whose job is to track down and eliminate renegade replicants (human-looking androids). K himself is a replicant, too, but an obedient one (at least at first) who follows rules set down by his stern but compassionate boss (Robin Wright). K\u2019s latest case eventually puts him on the trail of former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), but the screenplay by Hampton Fancher (one of the co-writers of the original movie) and Michael Green takes a long time getting there (or getting anywhere, really).\n\nFord\u2019s heavily hyped role is similar to his turn as Han Solo in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, a small supporting part (he doesn\u2019t show up until more than 90 minutes into the movie) that serves to bridge the gap between generations. Mainly, the story here is about K, and specifically about how his obsession with Deckard\u2019s case fuels his desire to be something more than a cog in a machine, whether by connecting with his holographic girlfriend (Ana de Armas) or by exploring memories of his own past (which may or may not be real). Gosling makes K into a well-rounded, sensitive figure whose emotions are easy to sympathize with, even if they\u2019re artificial.\n\nFord passes the baton effectively enough as Deckard, and Jared Leto gets in a few creepy moments as the power-hungry designer of the latest replicants, but it\u2019s the women who really stand out in the supporting cast: Wright as the weary cop, de Armas as the computer program who can never touch her lover, and especially Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks in a breakout performance as K\u2019s main replicant foe. The straightforward story is stretched pretty thin over the excessive 163-minute running time, but it\u2019s framed by such exquisite visuals (including a visit to an eerie, abandoned post-apocalyptic Las Vegas) that it\u2019s never less than breathtaking to watch. The original movie\u2019s design sense, world-building and atmosphere were all more fascinating than its story, and that\u2019s the case here again. If 2049 takes a while to build a following, every bit of it will be earned.",

The controversial director\u00a0uses the events of\u00a0the Columbine High School massacre to address the US'\u00a0addiction to guns.\n\nSadly, 14 years later the issues explored in this movie are still relevant.\n\nRatatouille\u00a0tells a compelling story through animation that isn't just for kids. Set in the posh Paris cooking world, Ratatouille\u00a0follows\u00a0a rat who fancies himself a chef.\n\nThe movie could have been a disaster, but instead it showed\u00a0that stories with lots of layers could\u00a0be told\u00a0well through cartoons and computer graphics.\n\nThere Will Be Blood (2007)\n\nThe Will Be Blood\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson delivers a film that is epic in so many ways,\u00a0including\u00a0its\u00a0story, its music, and\u00a0its\u00a0photography.\n\nDavid Fincher, who is known for his attraction\u00a0to dark material, was perfect for bringing\u00a0the story\u00a0of the Zodiac Killer to the big screen.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal plays a cartoonist for a newspaper who becomes obsessed with the case and takes over the detective work when the cops dry up on leads. Perhaps the best trick Fincher pulls off is building constant suspense so that, by the end, anyone could be the Zodiac.\n\nArguably Pixar's greatest work, \"WALL-E\" explores so many different issues that you can watch it a dozen times and\u00a0enjoy focusing on each one.\n\nFrom a love story to commentaries on obesity and climate change, the movie is\u00a0much more than the mere travels of a lovable robot (but that part is great, too).\n\nQuentin Tarantino's long-awaited Nazi-killing movie was worth the wait. Brad Pitt plays the leader of a group of Jewish US soldiers whose mission is to kill as many Nazis as possible in France.\n\nBut along with great characters like \"The Bear Jew\" and incredible action sequences, the film is also a love letter to cinema.\n\nFeaturing some of the funniest women in the business, \"Bridesmaids\" showed\u00a0that the girls could\u00a0be as funny and raunchy as the guys.\n\nAlong with finally giving Kristen Wiig the lead in a\u00a0movie, it also turned Melissa McCarthy into a movie star and Paul Feig into the go-to director for female comedies.\n\nDirector Nicolas Winding Refn takes his love of violence and combines it with Ryan Gosling and the music of Cliff Martinez to create a slick thriller that's in the vein of 80s movies like Thief\u00a0or To Live and Die In LA.\n\nThe cinematography and soundtrack alone put this film in the list, but the performances are what seal the deal.\n\nThis is one of those docs\u00a0that feels too horrific to be true.\u00a0Documentary filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer puts a spotlight on the genocide in Indonesia by befriending the leaders who were responsible for mass killings.\n\nHe had them reenact their murders by filming them in the movie genre of their choosing.\n\nThis article first appeared in The Business Insider.",

      "text": "OPINION: Well, that's it then. The end of my current socialising. All those invitations to friends' weddings and roof terrace barbecues and children's christenings will have to fall by the wayside. No more holidays. No evening phone calls. Nothing that risks taking me out of the country or diverting my attention away from my television screen.\n\nFor the next few weeks, I will have more important things to attend to. I refer, of course, to the return of Love Island, the\u00a0hit British reality series\u00a0that puts a group of highly telegenic millennials into a villa somewhere sunny, encourages them to couple up in order to win a cash prize and then films the results for public delectation.\n\nAll this must preferably be done while the men wear advantageously cut swimming trunks and the women sport bikinis constructed from little more than scraps of dental floss. It airs in New Zealand on TVNZ OnDemand.\n\nLast year, Love Island was a surprise hit in the UK, attracting 2.4 million viewers for the final, which saw contestants Kem and Amber crowned the winners. The couple later split, citing conflicting schedules. Still, as Lysander rightly says in A Midsummer Night's Dream: \"The course of true love never did run smooth, especially when there are nightclub public appearances to make and a clothing line for BooHoo.com to promote\" (I paraphrase).\n\nLove Island puts a group of highly telegenic millennials into a villa somewhere sunny, encourages them to couple up in order to win a cash prize and then films the results for public delectation.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\u00a0First look at Matilda Rice as host of Heartbreak Island\n\n*\u00a0Inside TVNZ's sexed-up new reality show Heartbreak Island\n\n*\u00a0Bafta-winning Love Island's Kiwi editor lifts the lid on the hit reality series\n\n*\u00a0Alice Brine: Happily stranded on UK's Love Island\n\n*\u00a0Love Island, what it is and why TVNZ is going to screen it\n\nLove Island's popularity prompted a tizzy of national debate. Everyone was talking about it: from earnest discussions on Radio 4's Woman's Hour to lengthy analyses in the broadsheets on whether the programme was trashy titillation or a compulsive examination of modern romance.\n\nBut I now realise that Love Island's influence was even more far-reaching than I initially appreciated. When I watched it this time last year, I was in a relationship. We broke up a couple of months after the finale (\"conflicting schedules\") and, aged 38, I was then pitched into the unforgiving world of 21st century dating. I downloaded all the necessary apps, called things like Bumble, Tinder or Hinge, as if they were high-spirited boys at a 1950s boarding school who had been given baffling nicknames.\n\nI dutifully filled out the questionnaires (\"How would your best friend describe you? What award should you be nominated for?\") and uploaded the requisite photos designed to make me look simultaneously approachable yet enigmatic.\n\nIt was as I started swiping left and matching with various men that the realisation dawned on me: Love Island had become an extended metaphor for modern dating.\n\nIt starts with the banter. Regular viewers of Love Island will know that \"bantz\" is often cited by both men and women as a highly desirable quality in a potential partner. In the olden days, it used to be referred to as GOSH in Lonely Hearts ads. It's an ability both to make and take a joke, often with some sort of sexual undertone. You must be able to parry and thrust with verbal ease, just as Chris did last season when he asked what the most common owl was in Britain before hilariously revealing it was \"a teat-owl\".\n\nLove Island is now in its fourth season in the UK.\n\nDating in 2018 is, at a modest guess, approximately 98 per cent Love Island-style bantering pre-amble. I had endless, lengthy messaging exchanges with men I'd never met and was never likely to meet. It would start off with an innocent question, \"So your profile says you like golf?\" and within seconds it would escalate to \"Yeah, and I'll show you how to get a hole in one [winking emoji]\" and soon your entire day is measured out not in coffee spoons but in how many borderline lewd jokes you can make.\n\nThe non-stop textual badinage is exhausting and ultimately dispiriting. Most of the time, just like Love Island, it doesn't go anywhere. It either fizzles out because you've reached bantz saturation point or you end up meeting in real life, walking into a dimly lit bar and knowing as soon as you've laid eyes on each other that you have no chemistry whatsoever and that all the meaningless texting was just that \u2013\u00a0meaningless.\n\nOften, this anti-climax will come about because a potential paramour has posted incredibly flattering (some might say untruthful) photos of themselves on their dating profile. This, too, is very Love Island. On it, everyone looks as if they have stepped out from the pages of a glossy brochure advertising a mid-market spa in Essex. They are bright-eyed with great hair and hyper-toned bodies and teeth that flash white in ultraviolet light.\n\nDebate has been fierce as to whether Love Island is trashy titillation or a compulsive examination of modern romance.\n\nOn dating apps, everyone now has to curate their own lives to look like a version of this same physical ideal. Men will take photos of themselves reflected in gym mirrors, pectoral muscles straining against their T-shirts like Love Island's Muggy Mike. Women will arch their backs and pout suggestively and apply Snapchat filters to make it look as if they've been lying in the sun for weeks a\u00a0la Montana Rose Brown or Olivia Attwood. Inevitable disappointment follows when you meet in the flesh. The truth is: looking as good as a Love Island contestant is basically a full-time job and the majority of us can't hope to compete because we have, well, full-time jobs. Love Island also brought it home to me just how disposable relationships have become.\n\nOn TV last year, I would watch mesmerised as the couples split up and re-formed with other halves as if this were just an expected course of action. Sure, there was a bit of an emotional fallout, but generally everyone simply got on with things.\n\nYet there were some subtle differences between the sexes. Whereas the men were initially happy to take what they could get, the women tended to get emotionally invested more quickly and see any hook-up as a potential future relationship.\n\nSure, there is a bit of an emotional fallout, but generally everyone on Love Island simply gets on with things.\n\nOnce again, this is reflected in the modern dating dynamic, where men appear to have the pick of the bunch.\n\nOn Bumble, it is up to the woman to make the first move, which you think sounds great, until you realise that all it means is that a distinctly mediocre bloke will get to feel like Ryan Gosling as his phone pings insistently with all the attention.\n\nYou will routinely be ghosted by men like this, who are bedazzled by choice, and who stop being in touch and never explain why.\n\nWomen, by contrast, are more likely to get their hopes up and indulge in some far-fetched romantic narrative, which ignores the fact the man they've matched with describes themselves as \"spiritual\" because they once read The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. Trust me, I've been there.\n\nAnd what if, by some miracles of miracles, you do end up in a relationship? Well then you have to play it all out in the full glare of social media for it to truly exist. You need to upload cutesy pictures to Instagram accompanied by captions like \"Spending time with #bae\" and tag each other in all your posts. It's as if you're creating your own reality TV programme, but played out for the benefit of your followers and friends rather than a prime-time audience.\n\nQuite frankly, it's a lot of bother for very little reward. Which is why I'd far rather watch other people dating so I don't have to. Welcome back, Love Island. My, how I've missed you.\n\nLove Island begins screening on TVNZ OnDemand from midday on June 6.",

So our family is just a little more late, I guess, at dinner time; a few more ancestors at the table.\n\n\u201cSo many times, if it\u2019s a birth family, you\u2019ll have the same dislike, you both don\u2019t like mayonnaise or something, you\u2019ll have that. But we have other different spices in there, so it can make it more challenging and it can make it more exciting.\u201d\n\nFutness, 64, shared how she encourages Oscar and Ava to honour their own heritage.\n\n\u201cWhen my son was younger, he found out he was part Bosnian, so we went and got this Croatian/Bosnian cookbook and he was very proud to carry that around when he was seven years old,\u201d Furness said.\n\n\u201cMy daughter has a Mexican lineage, so we\u2019ve been to Mexico.\u201d",

      "text": "The actress appeared in the trailer for the film about a young singer and songwriter who wakes up one day to find that the world had somehow forgotten the music of The Beatles. Seizing the opportunity, he suddenly becomes a worldwide sensation when he passes off their music as his own.\n\nAccording to the complaint, which was obtained by Fox News Digital, Conor Woulfe, 38, of Maryland, and Peter Michael Rosza, 44, of San Diego County, California, filed a class action complaint in the United States District Court of Central California against Universal. After they spent $US3.99 ($A5.60) each to rent the movie on Amazon Prime, they were upset to discover that the actress\u2019 part had been cut out of the movie.\n\nThe duo is seeking $US5 million ($A7 million) on behalf of themselves and all other affected consumers who may have spent money on the movie in the hopes of seeing the actress only to be disappointed. They accuse Universal of engaging in deceptive marketing.\n\n\u201cBecause consumers were promised a movie with Ana De Armas by the trailer for Yesterday, but did not receive a movie with any appearance of Ana de Armas at all, such consumers were not provided with any value for their rental or purchase,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nRepresentatives for de Armas did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nSpeaking to CinemaBlend in 2019, writer Richard Curtis explained that de Armas was going to play a character named Roxanne who would have acted as the third point on a love triangle between star Himesh Patel\u2019s Jack Malik and Lily James\u2019 Ellie. But it was later decided to cut the subplot because the filmmakers didn\u2019t want the main character to stray away from his principal love interest.\n\nAlthough the character made it to the trailer of the film, neither the actress nor her plot made it into Yesterday. As a result, many people like Woulfe and Rosza may have felt duped into renting or buying the movie.\n\nAs Variety notes, the suit bears some resemblance to a case involving the movie Drive that was filed in Michigan in 2011. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that the trailer made the movie seem like an action movie. Instead, the film was a thought-provoking, interpersonal drama starring Ryan Gosling.\n\nThat case was eventually ruled in favour of the defendants after they argued the trailer was protected under the First Amendment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fox News and was reproduced with permission",

      "text": "The feud between the two action stars was made public a few days ago when Johnson took to Instagram to blast some of his \u201ccandy ass\u201d male co-stars on the set of Fast 8 (It\u2019s since been revealed he was referring to Diesel).\n\nJohnson and Diesel have now joined a long list of movie stars who have butted heads during filming.\n\nHere are some others:\n\nThey ended up dating for four years, but when the two stars first met on the set of The Notebook they did not get on at all.\n\nIn 2014 the film\u2019s director, Nick Cassavetes, told VH1 about just how strained things were between the pair.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not supposed to tell this story, but they were really not getting along one day on set,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd Ryan came to me, and there\u2019s 150 people standing in this big scene, and he says, \u2018Nick come here!\u2019 He\u2019s doing a scene with Rachel and he says, \u2018Would you take her out of here and bring in another actor to read off camera with me?\u2019 I said, \u2018What?\u2019 He says, \u2018I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do it with her. I\u2019m just not getting anything from this\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe director summoned the two stars to his trailer so they could settle their differences which helped ... a little bit.\n\n\u201cThey started screaming and yelling at each other,\u201d Cassavetes said.\n\n\u201cI walked out. At that point I was smoking cigarettes. I smoked a cigarette and everybody came out like, \u2018Alright, let\u2019s do this\u2019. And it got better after that, you know?\n\n\u201cThey had it out \u2026 I think Ryan respected her for standing up for her character and Rachel was happy to get that out in the open. The rest of the film wasn\u2019t smooth sailing, but it was smoother sailing.\u201d\n\nThe police were called after the two stars came to blows on the set of Any Given Sunday.\n\nFoxx later addressed the punch-up in one of his stand-up comedy shows and said tensions flared when they were filming a scripted argument.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it (the scene) and in my mind I\u2019m thinking, \u2018This motherfu**er is really, really doing a great acting job or he\u2019s mad for real\u2019,\u201d Foxx said.\n\n\u201cWe get to arguing so much and the next thing you know he hauled off and hit me!\u201d\n\nThe punch definitely wasn\u2019t in the script.\n\nAccording to The Smoking Gun, Foxx filed battery charges against LL Cool J that were later dropped.\n\nThe two stars had a dust up on the set of Lawless with Hardy claiming that LaBeouf knocked him out.\n\n\u201cHe just attacked me,\u201d the actor said to Den Of Geek.\n\n\u201c[It was] behind the scenes. He knocked me out sparko. Out cold. He\u2019s a bad, bad boy. He is. He\u2019s quite intimidating as well. He\u2019s a scary dude.\u201d\n\nThe 2012 film\u2019s director, John Hillcoat, shot down Hardy\u2019s claim in a Reddit AMA that he was \u201cknocked out\u201d by LaBeouf but he did confirm the two fellas brawled.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely a fight between them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt escalated to the point where they had to both be restrained. But I was very pleased to hear it didn\u2019t go that way because I would hate to see the outcome.\u201d\n\nAfter starring alongside Franco in the 2006 film, Annapolis, Gibson told Playboy, \u201cI never want to work with him again.\u201d\n\nThe two clashed because Franco is a method actor and he refused to throw fake punches during a boxing scene with Gibson.\n\n\u201cI respect method actors, but he never snapped out of character,\u201d Gibson said to Elle magazine.\n\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019d have to get in the ring for boxing scenes, and even during practice, the dude was full-on hitting me.\n\n\u201cIt felt very personal,\u201d Gibson said to Playboy, \u201cIt was fu**ed-up.\u201d\n\nFranco later accepted \u201cfull blame\u201d for the issues between the pair and admitted he was \u201cprobably a jerk\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was not purposely cruel to him, but I was probably so wrapped up in my performance that I was not as friendly as I could have been,\u201d Franco said in GQ.\n\nThe two stars had a heated clash on the set of Charlie\u2019s Angels which later admitted was a big misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cWe began rehearsing this scene and I said, \u2018Lucy, how can you want to say these lines? These are so crazy\u2019,\u201d Murray explained in 2003.\n\n\u201cShe got furious with me because she thought it was a personal assault, but the reality is she hated these lines as much as I did. But for 15 or 20 minutes there, we went to our separate corners and threw hand-grenades and sky rockets at each other.\u201d\n\nThe legendary actor addressed the on set spat again in 2009 when he spoke to The Times.\n\n\u201cLook, I will dismiss you completely if you are unprofessional and working with me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen our relationship is professional, and you\u2019re not getting that done, forget it.\u201d\n\nThe two actors weren\u2019t exactly best buds on the set of the 1997 Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies.\n\n\u201cI got very upset with her,\u201d Brosnan later said to the Daily Mirror, \u201cshe was always keeping me waiting for hours\u201d.\n\n\u201cI must admit I let slip a few words which weren\u2019t very nice.\u201d\n\nAwkwardly, Brosnan later found out the reason Hatcher always kept him waiting was because she was battling morning sickness.\n\n\u201cIt came out one morning that Teri was pregnant and she hadn\u2019t been feeling very well,\u201d he said to Vanity Fair.\n\nTheron admitted to Esquire that her and Hardy \u201cfu**in\u2019 went at it\u201d on several occasions as they spent months six months working side-by-side in the Namibian desert for Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nThe film\u2019s director, George Miller, told the Wall Street Journal that tensions were running high between the stars during filming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that they were seething right through,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the trajectory of the character can\u2019t help but seep into the work.\u201d\n\nTheron was reportedly frustrated that Hardy refused to break character in-between scenes.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, he\u2019s not like that on every movie,\u201d she said to the Wall Street Journal, \u201cI hear he\u2019s had good experiences.\n\n\u201cMaybe the movie is what it is because we struggled so much with each other, and those characters had to struggle so much with each other. If we were chum-chum, maybe the movie would have been 10 times worse.\u201d",

I don\u2019t know exactly how Christmas is going to go down this year but it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d He grins. \u201cShe\u2019s an angel.\u201d\n\nThe other angel in his life is of course his significant other, Eva Mendes, with whom he is raising Esmeralda Amada Gosling. The photogenic couple began a relationship in 2011 when they shot the film, A Place Beyond the Pines. Prior to Mendes, he was romantically linked to Sandra Bullock (2002 \u2014 2003) and Rachel McAdams (2005 \u2014 2007, and again in 2008). What attributes does Mendes possess other than obvious physical beauty that he finds irresistible?

I\u2019ve heard that record more than enough, but I\u2019m sure it will be on a loop his year as well,\u201d he laughs.

It would be the prelude to his career as a child star on The Mickey Mouse Club (from 1993 to 1995) where he honed his singing and dancing abilities alongside Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.\n\n\u201cEveryone in my family worked in a paper mill, and when I was 7 years old my uncle came to live with us. He was an Elvis impersonator. One day I saw him, bedazzling in a white jumpsuit, standing in our living-room. He decided that, that day he was going to become Elvis. He started talking like Elvis, walking like Elvis and singing like Elvis,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was certainly the most interesting thing that ever happened to our family, actually our town.\u201d He laughs. \u201cAnd soon afterwards I put myself in dance classes.\u201d\n\nThose classes proved invaluable to him well into his adult life. He\u2019s currently filming a musical, La La Land, set in contemporary LA between a jazz pianist and an actress. He stars with Emma Stone which marks their third onscreen romance following Crazy Stupid Love, in 2011, and Gangster Squad, in 2013.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t care what anyone thinks of it because I had so much fun making it. It\u2019s sort of in the Fred and Ginger tradition. It\u2019s very dance heavy, although it\u2019s light on its feet, if you will,\u201d he jokes. \u201cWe did a lot of tap dancing. I don\u2019t sing too many songs on my own, thank God, you\u2019re welcome for that. I did a few duets with Emma, who man\u2019s the helm of the singing portion of the movie. But as I\u2019m a jazz pianist, I play a lot of piano in the film.\u201d\n\nOff-screen, Gosling has been the unwilling subject of the \u2018Hey Girl,\u2019 meme, an internet phenomenon that came from his supposed frequent use of the phrase he\u2019s uttered in many of his movies. And although he\u2019s portrayed in a flattering light in these images, Gosling visibly cringes when I ask him how he feels about it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how it started, I don\u2019t know why it started; I\u2019m just hoping it will end soon.\u201d Does he find any humour in it, or is it merely annoying? (apparently like the question, it would seem). He sighs. \u201cIt depends on the day.\u201d\n\nNext up, Gosling is one of the main characters in the Golden Globe award-nominated satire, The Big Short, an ensemble which includes Christian Bale, Steve Carell and Brad Pitt. Gosling is unrecognisable wearing dyed black hair, brown contact lenses and a spray tan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s loosely based on a real person,\u201d he explains. The movie is about the 2008 economic crash based on the book by Michael Lewis and I play a banker with Deutsche Bank. Director Adam McKay, head writer of SNL who co-wrote Talladega Nights, Step Brothers and Anchorman, refers to his film as a \u2018traumedy.\u2019\n\nIn real life, is Gosling a savvy businessman when he\u2019s not preening himself for the cameras or changing nappies at home? \u201cGod, no,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI think my eyes roll over when financial subjects come up. It\u2019s a testament to both Michael Lewis and Adam McKay that they were able to make a subject that\u2019s so alienating feel so accessible. It\u2019s something I have no interest in whatsoever.\u201d\n\nYet according to Forbes magazine, Gosling has a net worth of US$36 million. What has been his best investment to date? \u201cMy family,\u201d he says, without any hesitation. \u201cI feel very lucky.\u201d",

      "text": "Yet another year in the midst of a seemingly never-ending global pandemic has passed us by. And much like last year when this all began, it has exposed the startling rate of existing social inequities, especially those relating to women.\n\nOne of the worst impacts has been increased rates of violence against women, with far too many women experiencing an increase in physical, emotional and online abuse.\n\nAccording to Destroy the Joint, 38 women have been killed this year, many who have died at the hands of a partner or ex-partner. In 2015, my 23-year-old sister Nikita was one of those women.\n\nTo those who knew Niki \u2013 as we affectionately called her \u2013 she wasn\u2019t just a statistic. Niki was a loved sister, daughter and friend to many, and her life was tragically cut short by her partner who stabbed her to death.\n\nEvery year since Nikita\u2019s murder, I have had many conversations with men \u2013 in person and online \u2013 about intimate partner violence, coercive control, sexism and misogyny.\n\nThese conversations are unavoidable for me, because who can look away when we see such high rates of men\u2019s violence and finally, the news is covering these incidents?\n\nThis year alone, we have read about the thousands of young men who coerced and pressured young women into sex, as part of the testimonies on Chanel Contos\u2019 Teach Us Consent petition, not to mention the many men responsible for workplace abuse and harassment, which led to the Australian Human Rights Commission\u2019s Respect@Work report.\n\nAnd there\u2019s also the high-profile male sport stars who have abused or harassed women.\n\nMost men I know, and have spoken to, agree that all acts of violence against women need to be condemned and that this violence needs to stop.\n\nThey also agree that perpetrators should be held to account, and that we need responsive measures, such as through our law and criminal justice system.\n\nBut when it comes to what we need to do stop violence before it starts, the conversations become more complex and uncomfortable. A lot of men think that if they aren\u2019t violent themselves, then what could they possibly do?\n\nWhile some men are engaged and involved in being part of the solution, by calling out disrespect and actively supporting gender equality, some are not. Some are still uncomfortable challenging their mates\u2019 sexist attitudes and don\u2019t see gender equality as an issue on which men should be taking action.\n\nThe reality is we still have a long way to go.\n\nToday, Our Watch launched the second edition of Change the Story, a national framework focused on ending men\u2019s violence against women, which makes clear the connection between men and masculinities, gender inequality and violence against women.\n\nThis is significant, because violence against women in Australia is overwhelmingly perpetrated by men. For most women this violence is from a man that they know.\n\nBut we also know that this violence is not inevitable, it is preventable.\n\nThe evidence shows that men who conform to rigid ideas of how to be a man \u2013 being dominant, in control, tough, aggressive and stoic are more likely to be sexist and disrespectful towards women, and ultimately more likely to be violent towards them.\n\nChange the Story highlights that we need to look at the ways our systems, structures and broader culture is contributing to gender inequality and perpetuating harmful gender expectations for everyone, particularly men.\n\nThis includes, for example, the expectation that men should be the breadwinners, and not primary carers for their children.\n\nWe see this playing out in many workplaces, but especially male-dominated ones, which have fewer part-time employees, and a culture of long work hours. Less flexibility means that men are unable to spend the same amount of time with their kids and this puts more pressure on their female partners.\n\nBy having less opportunity for equal parenting, working fathers are robbed of choice as well. And we know that dads today want to play a more hands-on and active parenting role compared to their fathers, so it seems like a no-brainer for workplaces to support this.\n\nWe also see gender stereotyping play out in pop culture, where a male character\u2019s jealousy or controlling behaviour is cast as \u2018romantic\u2019 in a story, or in advertising where men are cast as tough or emotionless, as if that\u2019s the only way to \u2018be a man\u2019.\n\nI think many of us can now acknowledge on reflection, that Ryan Gosling\u2019s character in The Notebook, hanging off the Ferris wheel while demanding a date is less romantic than it seemed at the time.\n\nSome of the stereotypical characteristics of masculinity are not necessarily harmful in and of themselves, but they can become a problem when men feel like they must conform and live up to these stereotypes consistently, and when they pressure other men to fit the same mould. This rigid attachment to these ideas helps maintain gender inequality, which we know creates the conditions for violence against women.\n\nThere are countless ways to \u201cbe a man\u201d, and by addressing these rigid ideas and stereotypes of masculinity at all levels of society, we can contribute to the prevention of violence against women.\n\nIf there is one symbolic and powerful gesture for masculinity in 2021 it is the photograph by James Robinson who burnt his St Kevin\u2019s blazer in response to the misogynistic and homophobic culture he experienced at the school. Rather than being an act of defiance, Robinson said that it was an act of healing and of regeneration.\n\nWhile many men know that we need to change, we also know that individual action can only take us so far. To continue to stamp out gender inequality, we must look at the broader social and structural changes, which is what Change the Story focuses on.\n\nBut this is also an opportunity to be honest, come together and look at how we can all create a better future by taking collective action.\n\nHopefully, like Robinson hopes, it can be a regeneration.\n\nTarang Chawla is an Our Watch Ambassador, Victorian Multicultural Commissioner and Founder of Not One More Niki.

      "text": "Last week, Sam said goodbye to his trademark red afro and emerged from his makeover looking like a totally different person. And before that, scruffy Kiran underwent the season\u2019s first makeover, to a rapturous reception.\n\nFour more big makeovers below...\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, 27-year-old Dungeons and Dragons fan George was definitely on the \u201cconventionally handsome man who hasn\u2019t shaved in a while\u201d end of the Geek spectrum. Still, the makeover\u2019s pretty impressive:\n\nHis makeover also earned the episode\u2019s biggest reactions, with George\u2019s \u2018Beauty\u2019, Josie, looking like she was in need of urgent medical attention. \u201cYou look so good \u2026 you look hot. Is that you?\u201d she asked.\n\nGeorge said he felt \u201ccompletely different. Younger, and so confident.\u201d\n\nMotorsports nut Lachlan, 32, couldn\u2019t hide his blushes when his new look was met with squeals from the beauties. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I walked out to beautiful girls and got a reaction like that,\u201d he said shyly.\n\nLachie\u2019s mum usually buys his clothes \u2013 what would she think of the new outfit? \u201cProbably not the sort of thing she would\u2019ve bought me on her own, but I think she\u2019ll approve.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Shock twist in Beauty and the Geek\n\n\u201cYou were always handsome, but now you\u2019re extra handsome,\u201d said 25-year-old cosplay fanatic James\u2019 beauty, Jess, after his reveal. The new look even earned him a comparison to Ryan Gosling from another of the Beauties.\n\nJames couldn\u2019t believe it either, busting out a few dance moves when he first saw himself in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m so happy with the look \u2013 hopefully it lets me be more confident,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was some speculation from the Beauties about how the makeover would tackle Alex\u2019s receding hairline \u2013 \u201cI think they\u2019re going to give him a wig,\u201d whispered Aira. Thankfully, that was not the case \u2013 instead, the clippers came out for a fresh new look.\n\nAlex made a surprisingly heartbreaking confession before he was allowed to look at himself in the mirror.\n\n\u201cIn my life, I\u2019ve only ever looked in the mirror and been deeply disappointed and regretful,\u201d he revealed. \u201cSo I\u2019m very nervous.\u201d\n\nAnd his verdict after seeing his new look? \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.

      "text": "The world of Power Rangers seems to be going through a transition ever since being sold off to Hasbro. Hasbro seems to want to expand the brand. Revealed via a Facebook post; Hasbro are currently looking into all kinds of different forms of media to branch the series into. Including the a possible animated series.\n\nFor a few months now there have been rumors that Hasbro plans to end the current and long-running Power Rangers format. The one that involves splicing Japanese Super Sentai with American made footage. It should be noted that these rumors are not official at this time. However, more and more evidence seems to be mounting that Power Rangers is in for a big shift.\n\nThe official Facebook statement states that\n\nHasbro and eOne are exploring all different forms of content for Power Rangers including theatrical, including streaming, [and] including new animation. [\u2026]  Just too early to announce exactly what that roadmap is, but hopefully  as we enter next year we\u2019ll have some clarity on the next ideation of  Power Rangers.\n\nThough the statement is vague parts of it do line up with other rumors regarding the future of Power Rangers. We already know that Hasbro has a new Power Rangers movie in development. One that is said to be set in the 90s and will have nothing to do with the 2017 movie.\n\nHasbro\u2019s Power Rangers has also seen great success with branching into other media as of late. The IDW Power Rangers comic book has been a phenomenal hit. Spawning an entirely new branch of Rangers and giving rise to new fan favorite character like Drakon.\n\nPower Rangers has also seen success in toys with the new ongoing Lighting Collection that is now on wave 5, and on the video game front. Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid has been done very well for itself and many have even clamored for it to be in EVO.\n\nCould we see an animated Power Ranger series down the line? And could  it\u2019s creation have anything to do with the rumors of Hasbro supposedly  parting ways with Toei?  So, what do you think about the rumors of a Hasbro produced animated series?",

      "text": "One Piece, like so many other anime and media, is having its production schedule screwed by COVID-19. Pandemics really do ruin everything.\n\nAs it turns out, not even Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates are immune to the effects of COVID-19. While we all knew that intellectually, it\u2019s only when the production schedule starts slipping does it finally hit us in the gut. That\u2019s what this bit of news is: a gut punch to all the fans of One Piece. Someone needs to put a 50 billion berry bounty on the virus already, if that were at all possible.\n\nAs for which One Piece media will experience release delays, it\u2019s actually quite a few items. The One Piece manga volume #97, One Piece Magazine Vol. 10, and One Piece by Eiichiro Oda Tiger Color Walk 9 art book will all be delayed. Their original release date was supposed to be September 4, but now it will be moved to September 16. It\u2019s a delay of nearly 2 weeks, which quite frankly sucks.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the pandemic has caused problems for One Piece though. Back in April, Shueisha delayed this year\u2019s 21st issue of Weekly Shonen Jump for a week due to concerns about a possible infected individual in the editorial department. And then in May, Shueisha delayed the 2-part prequel manga to the One Piece: Stampede movie for 2 weeks, again due to COVID-19 concerns. Heck, even in May, Oda-sensei himself warned that more delays were coming as his staff reorganize the workplace so that they can all experience the joys of social distancing.\n\nYeah, I think it\u2019s safe to say that this latest delay won\u2019t be the last one we\u2019ll experiences.\n\nThat blasted COVID-19 pandemic will now delay 3 whole publications for One Piece. I guess looking on the bright side, a nearly 2 week delay isn\u2019t so bad in the grand scheme of things. It could\u2019ve been worse.",

This @versace is definitely up there. I\u2019m not often asked what my favourite parenting quote is, but I\u2019ll post it anyway,\u201d Mendes wrote, going on to post the quote: \u201cSpanking does for a child\u2019s development what hitting a spouse does for a marriage.\u201d\n\nThe Hitch actress shares two daughters, Esmeralda Amada, 6, and Amada Lee, 4, with partner Ryan Gosling.\n\nIn the comment section, several followers didn\u2019t agree with Mendes\u2019 methods, with one person writing, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was spanked and now I\u2019m a respectful adult. And believe me, I deserved those whoopings. I was a brat.\u201d\n\nMendes responded, \u201cThank you for your comment. So happy to agree to disagree. Want this page to offer that in a loving way. We all parent our own way and I have no idea what I\u2019m doing most the time.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThis didn\u2019t come with a manual so when there\u2019s something that resonates with me, I pass it on. Lotsa love.\u201d\n\nAnother person wrote how they \u201ccompletely disagree\u201d and their \u201cgoal in raising kids is not to have to spank, but it\u2019s correcting before they can reason behaviour out with you. Completely different from hitting someone. That\u2019s not correcting behaviour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for a respectful comment. So nice to disagree with respect. I found the quote powerful and wanted to pass it on. Lotsa love to and yours.\u201d\n\nMendes has taken a break from acting since welcoming her two kids, but said in October 2020 to The Sunday Morning Herald that after a few years at home with her children, she\u2019s coming around to the idea of heading back to work.\n\n\u201cI applaud and look up to those women who can do it all, but I\u2019m not one of them \u2013 and, thankfully, I have a choice not to work and I realise how fortunate I am that it\u2019s even a choice,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so happy to be able to incubate with my babies, but now they are four and six, I\u2019m starting to feel like my ambition is coming back.\u201d\n\nWhile Mendes has loved her time at home with the little ones, she admitted that life in quarantine has been tough.\n\n\u201cSometimes it feels like we are running some kind of bed and breakfast with very drunk and aggressive guests,\u201d Mendes joked.\n\n\u201cWe really do feel like we are working in a hotel, and the guests are angry and bossy and demand food brought to them. And by the time they go to sleep, we\u2019re left to just clean up and talk about how they\u2019ve treated us that day!\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fox News and was reproduced with permission",

We were delighted when Eva agreed, and we thought this role would be perfect for her.\"\n\nWant to join the family? Sign up to the\u00a0Kidspot newsletter\u00a0for more stories like this.\n\nMendes has obviously been watching the award-winning Aussie show with her kids, Esmeralda, 7, and Amada, 5, who she shares with partner Ryan Gosling.\n\nMendes told Women's Health in 2019 that she had no plans on starting a family...until she met Gosling.\n\n\"It was the furthest thing from my mind,\" she said.\n\n\"[Then] Ryan Gosling happened,\" she said. \"I mean, falling in love with him. Then it made sense for me to have\u2026 not kids, but his kids. It was very specific to him.\"\n\nYes, we can ENTIRELY understand that Eva.\n\nRELATED:\u00a0Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes reveal their one strict parenting rule\n\nEva Mendes and Ryan Gosling have two daughters together.

Bluey and Bingo have to guide him through his second day on Earth, especially when he discovers food is delicious and steals Lucky's Dad's pie.\n\nThe third season of the show recently dropped and there may well be some other star cameos to come.\n\nThe stars who will never have their identity revealed however, are Bluey and Bingo, which production crew told Kidspot was for their own protection.\n\n\u201cAll the children on the show are members of the family of people in production. I am so glad that the creatives on the show decided that no one would be in the credits to protect the young cast.\u201d",

Together with Jason Donovan, she was one half of the show\u2019s most famous pairings: Charlene and Scott.\n\nKylie\u2019s popularity soared when she and Jason teamed up for their iconic duet, Especially For You, and made her devoted fans squeal with delight when it was revealed the actors\u2019 on-screen chemistry has spilled into an off-set romance. It didn\u2019t last long, but for many, Kylie and Jason will forever be a duo that holds a special place in their soapie-loving hearts.\n\nAfter three years on the show, Kylie launched her singing career in 1988 with her first solo hit, Locomotion, and has since won a slew of awards, including a Grammy and 17 ARIAs.\n\nHaving recently received an OBE from the Queen herself, Kylie has relocated back to her hometown of Melbourne after 30 years in the UK, and is long-distance dating her magazine creator director boyfriend, Paul Solomon.\n\nRELATED:\u00a0Kylie Minogue took motherhood for \u201cgranted\u201d until it was too late\n\nWhen he joined the cast in 1986 at the tender age of 17, Jason Donovan made many a teenage heart flutter with his lovable role as Scott Robinson.\n\nAfter three years on the soap, Jason launched a successful music career in the UK, where he\u2019s been based ever since.\n\nHe went on to make a name for himself on the London West End stage, and has released six studio albums.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all roses, however. The performer has been open about his drug addictions and how he credits wife, Angela Malloch, for pulling him out of the darkest moments of his life.\n\nThe couple have three children, Jemma, 21, Zac, 20, and Molly, 10.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t watched Neighbours in recent times, you would have missed Jemma following in her dad\u2019s footsteps, appearing in the role of Harlow Robinson.\n\nThe actor got her lucky break on Neighbours as Donna Freedman in 2011, and has risen to become a Hollywood heavyweight in her own right.\n\nMargot\u2019s US career hit its first high note when she stole the screen opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf Of Wall Street.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s starred in a number of films, and scored two Oscar nominations - one for best actress in 2017 for her role as ice skater Tonya Harding in I, Tonya, and the other as best supporting actress in Once Upon A Time.\n\nNow filming the big-screen Barbie movie alongside Ryan Gosling, Margot is currently one of Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actors and bases herself in California with her British director and producer husband, Tom Ackerley.\n\nMany wouldn\u2019t realise it, but this Hollywood star got his start as paraplegic athlete Josh Taylor in Neighbours from 2007 to 2008.\n\nDespite losing the role of Thor to older brother, Chris, Liam went onto become a bankable talent in the hit films, The Last Song, and The Hunger Games.\n\nOff-screen, he\u2019s also famously known as Miley Cyrus\u2019 ex-husband.\n\nNext month, he\u2019s set to appear in the TV series, Most Dangerous Game.\n\nRELATED:\u00a0Miley Cyrus on her \u2018unconventional marriage\u2019 to Liam Hemsworth\n\nIt was a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it role, but the Gladiator had a guest appearance on Neighbours as ex-con, Kenny Larkin, for four episodes in 1987.\n\nHis most famous role since was that of the famous Roman fighter, but many will also remember him from Romper Stomper, A Beautiful Mind, and The Insider.\n\nHis efforts won him an Academy Award, two Golden Globes and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and he\u2019s set to return to the big screen for the upcoming film, The Pope\u2019s Exorcist.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Holly Valance entered our living rooms as Felicity \u201cFlick\u201d Scully.\n\nPost Neighbours, she made her mark as a pop singer. Her debut single, Kiss Kiss topped the charts, and she went on to release two albums and have two other successful singles, Down Boy and Naughty Girl.\n\nWhile she returned to acting in 2004 in minor roles, it\u2019s her marriage to insanely wealthy British property developer, Nick Candy, which has mostly kept her in the headlines.\n\nThe US-based couple have two daughters, Luka, eight, and Nova, four.\n\nThe 37-year-old singer-songwriter entered the Neighbours cast to launch her ailing early musical career - and that\u2019s exactly what it did, and a whole lot more.\n\nJoining the show at just 17 as shy songwriter Nina Tucker, Delta fast became a much-loved national treasure.\n\nWhile she bravely battled Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, which caused her to leave the soap, her career went on to reach even greater success, with numerous best-selling albums and a long-standing role as a coach on The Voice Australia.\n\nThe actor made his mark as Mike Young, the mulleted best friend of Scott Robinson, in 1986.\n\nHe may be best remembered, however, as a drag queen in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but went on to have other notable roles in the Hollywood films, LA Confidential, Momento, The Hurt Locker and The King's Speech.\n\nGuy is currently based in Amsterdam with partner Carice van Houten (of Games of Thrones fame) and their five-year-old son, Monte.\n\nThe 47-year-old had a brief appearance on Neighbours as Beth Brennan, which catapulted her mostly UK-based singing career.\n\nShe\u2019s most famous for her chart-topping cover of the song, Torn and her marriage to Silverchair frontman, Daniel Johns, which ended in 2008.\n\nMore recently, she\u2019s re-entered our living rooms as an X-Factor judge, while behind the scenes, she\u2019s a solo parent to her two-year-old son, Max Valentine, who she conceived via IVF with an anonymous sperm donor.\n\nRELATED:\u00a0Natalie Imbruglia on her struggle with motherhood\n\nWho could forget bad girl Izzy Hoyland, who landed herself in a nasty love triangle with Dr Karl and his wife, Susan.\n\nThe memorable role in 2007 (and then again in 2018) made a household name out of the 46-year-old, who went onto become the lead singer of pop group, The Rogue Traders (of Voodoo Child fame), then a successful solo performer and long-lasting TV talent on The X Factor and So You Think You Can Dance.\n\nNatalie is married to her Rogue Traders bandmate Cameron McGlinchey and they share two children, Harper, 10, and Hendrix, seven.\n\nThe 43-year-old actor played Billy Kennedy for six years before jetting off to Hollywood.\n\nJesse went on to star in the series, House and Chicago Fire, and is about to star in the Disney+ dramedy, Last Days of the Spage Age.\n\nHe remains based in the US with his scientist wife, Kali Woodruff.\n\nThe actor played the dad we all wanted to have - Jim Robinson - for eight illustrious years before he moved to the US to pursue a Hollywood career, where he remains still working today..\n\nHe\u2019s scored many plum roles, such as on The O. C, Lost, 24, Ugly Betty, and many more.\n\nNeighbours will officially end with a 90-minute special to be simultaneously aired on Channels 10 and 10 Peach from 7.30pm tonight.",

      "text": "Here's a confession, half-heartedly given, since I've already owned to it on this very website\u00a0before: I have a massive crush on David Mitchell. Sure, if you ask me who my celebrity hall pass is, I'll mumble something about Jake Gyllenhaal or Ryan Gosling, hell, I'll even go to bat for the Benedict Cumberbatches and Tom Hiddlestons of the world.\n\nBut really, deep down, I'm harbouring some pretty non-pg-rated thoughts about David Mitchell, a British comedian best known for his role on sitcom Peep Show. Although if you ask me, and hell, I am, he's best on\u00a0Would I Lie To You, a barnstorming sketch show that will lift anyone from the depths of doldrums. Just watch this clip.\n\nWhile he\u00a0might be a man who was\u00a0smart and funny and in touch with his emotions, let's be honest, he's no Ryan Reynolds. (Who am I to judge, though, really? Anyway, this is my Internet Boyfriend\u2122 fantasy and I should be allowed to set the parameters.)\n\nWomen have been falling for funny men for years. And today, a new study from the Abertay University in Scotland has been released, investigating why. Women were shown an array of pictures of men, some conventionally attractive and others less so, asking them to rank them based on based on their physical looks.\n\nThings went pretty much as you can imagine until the second round of the study. That's when the women were given information about each man: Their sense of humour, their creativity and imagination, their smarts. Suddenly, the rankings shifted. \"Creative guys with less attractive faces were almost identical in attractiveness to really good-looking guys who were not as creative,\" Dr Christopher Watkins, who spearheaded the study, told\u00a0The Australian. Funny guys came out on top.\n\nNow, if only the same could be said for the women in the study. Volunteers who rated the images of less-attractive women who displayed a sense of humour and \"mental zing\", as the study ominously calls it, were alarmingly rated lower than those without the same personality traits. \"Creative women with less attractive faces seem to be perhaps penalised in some way,\" Watkins noted.\n\nTo which we say:\u00a0Great.\u00a0We'll always have our\u00a0Internet Boyfriends\u2122, though, right?",

Sign up to our\u00a0Kidspot newsletter\u00a0for more stories like this.\n\nBaby naming site, Namberry, has released the top gender-neutral baby names of 2021, and if you're looking for ideas, there are bound to be some trendy options here.\n\nLOGAN: The most popular of them all, this comes from Scottish origins and means \"small hollow\". It's also a suburb in Brisbane and the name of famous YouTuber, Logan Paul.\n\nAVERY: Becoming more popular for baby girls, the unisex name means \"ruler of the elves\" which is pretty adorable if you ask us!\n\nRILEY: Coming in at number three is from Irish origins and means \"rye clearing; courageous.\"\n\nPARKER: Parker means \"park keeper\" and although it's unisex, it's more commonly used on boys than girls (about three times more, to be precise),\n\nCAMERON: What was once very much a boy's name, Cameron has been becoming increasingly popular among girls, too. It means \"crooked nose\" but take one look at Cameron Diaz and you'll agree it's a great name for both genders.\n\nRYAN: From Irish origins meaning \"little king,\" this moniker belongs to the ultimate Ken doll, Ryan Gosling.\n\nRIVER: If you're looking for a more nature-based gender-neutral baby name, this one might be just the one for you.\n\nANGEL: For a more ethereal baby name, you might want to consider Angel. Don't be fooled by the slightly feminine vibe, just take a look at Angel from Buffy, the Vampire Slayer. It's also very popular among males in the Latino community.\n\nROWAN: This name comes from Scottish and Irish origins meaning \"rowan tree; little redhead.\" Think Rowan Atkinson or American actress and political activist, Rowan Blanchard.\n\nJORDAN: From Hebrew origin meaning \"flowing down,\" this name is associated with basketballer, Michael Jordan and the biblical River Jordan.\n\nSome other adorable options that didn't quite make the top 10 are Charlie, Quinn, Peyton, Emerson and Eden.\n\nRELATED:\u00a0Baby name consultant\u2019s list of names with bad meanings\n\nIf the more traditional names aren't your thing, the good people at Nameberry also listed some unique options you may like to consider.\n\nWhat about the colour name, Crimson?\n\nOr aim for the stars with a celestial name like Solaris.\n\nRumi was a Persian poet... perhaps it's also the name of your future child.\n\nOr maybe you might consider about some location-based gender-neutral options like Austen or Tennessee.\n\nDo you have a favourite gender-neutral name?

      "text": "If you turn into a blubbering mess every time you watch The Notebook, you\u2019ll definitely be interested in what we have to show you.\n\nA video of Rachel McAdams\u2019 audition tape for her role as Allie Hamilton in the much-loved romantic flick has resurfaced and well, you might just be adding to that puddle of tears.\n\nThe audition video shows Rachel performing the big fight scene between Allie and Noah, where Allie admits she is confused about the future of their relationship and her existing relationship with her fianc\u00e9 Lon.\n\nRachel reads through the scene with co-star Ryan Gosling, and while he is not pictured in the video, there\u2019s no denying their amazing chemistry \u2013 even before filming actually began.\n\nAll of the feels. Image: YouTube\n\nMad about The Notebook? Here are some weird facts about the film you didn't know. Or if it's Ryan Gosling who really floats your boat, here's how he can save your marriage. Yes, really.\n\nWhile the audition video has been around for some time, it has resurfaced online, bring back all of those Notebook feels.\n\nRachel delivers the classic lines, \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple\u201d when questioned by Noah if she will stay with him or return to her fianc\u00e9.\n\nHer delivery of another standout line: \u201cI know that they happened and they were wonderful but they were also very irresponsible,\u201d is like we\u2019re watching the actual film rather than the audition.\n\nThe famous scene that Rachel tested with. Image: Supplied\n\nThe clip has had over seven million views since it was posted on YouTube and as predicted, we\u2019re not the only fans blown away by the star\u2019s performance that ultimately secured her the role.\n\n\u201cNo wonder she got the part. I forgot I was even watching an audition,\u201d one fan commented on the clip.\n\nAnd another fan of the film shared: \"It's just so intense and perfect. Rachel is just so amazing! Her acting is on point.\u201d\n\nWe couldn\u2019t agree more. Now if you excuse me, I\u2019ve got a hot date with my couch, some wine, and The Notebook \u2026 to relive it all again.",

      "text": "They're just a few of the hats that Eva Mendes switches between in life.\n\nDespite her different pursuits, one thing has remained constant -her fierce and admirable dedication to the privacy of her family.\n\nMendes shares two children with her husband, Ryan Gosling, Esmeralda, 8, and Amada, 6, and is known for maintaining a low profile away from the cameras.\n\n\"My man and my kids are private,\" the Cuban American actress once said.\n\nThat's why when\u00a0Kidspot\u00a0was given the opportunity to chat with Mendes, we jumped at the wonderful opportunity.\n\nShe was warm, honest and vulnerable and offered a rare insight into her and Ryan's parenting styles.\n\nWant to join the family? Sign up to our Kidspot newsletter for more stories like this.\n\nWhen talking about what she's like as a mum, Eva Mendes joked, \"It depends on the day, it depends on the time of month.\"\n\nShe told Kidspot, \"I try and work on myself as much as possible. I really like the idea of re-parenting myself as I'm raising my kids.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I love Dr. Shefali's book and whole philosophy of conscious parenting.\n\n\"I have also found a really great support system on social media, not only with Dr. Shefali but Dr. Becky... she's incredible.\n\n\"There's also gentle parenting. There are so many amazing people and movements on social that support the type of parent I try to be.\"\n\nDr. Shefali is a clinical psychologist and New York Times bestselling author. Her philosophy shifts the traditional parent-child relationship away from the standard parent-to-child 'know it all' approach to a mutual 'parent-with-child' relationship in which the parent learns alongside their child.\n\nDr. Becky is also a clinical psychologist who opposes the traditional reward-and-punishment model of parenting. Her teaching involves exploring attachment styles, mindfulness and emotion regulation in regard to parenting.\n\nMendes continued, \"[Parenting] can be maddening at times, it's the little things that kind of make me crazy.\n\n\"So if I'm not working on myself, going to therapy, taking care of myself, going for a walk when I feel like I'm not going to handle something well, then I'm not being the best mum I can be... so I'm always working on myself first.\"\n\nWhen asked about parenting with her husband, actor Ryan Gosling, she said that there was no 'good cop-bad cop' dynamic but rather they try to parent in a way that's specific to each individual situation.\n\n\"We're talkers, we want to talk everything out.\n\n\"We really try and empower the kids to be like 'you have a voice here.' Doesn't mean you're going to get your way, but you have a voice, so let's all talk about it. So we're like big talkers in our family.\"\n\nMendes is currently in Australia with her family while Ryan is filming The Fall Guy in Sydney.\n\nWhile Mendes is here, she's an Ambassador for McHappy Day and has been visiting families staying at Ronald McDonald House in Westmead.\n\nShe says it's a cause 'close to her heart' as her cousin's child was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma when they were one. While travelling around the states trying to find treatment, her cousin found Ronald McDonald charity and it helped keep the family together during that tough time.\n\nWhen visiting the Ronald McDonald House, she says she has pinch-me moments all the time and is in a \"constant state of gratitude\" about her family's health.\n\n\"I, unfortunately, lost my brother to cancer just a few years ago.\n\n\"My mother raised us paycheck-to-paycheck and with the philosophy that things could always be worse. So I'm always grateful. Since I lost my brother... there's those moments you get frustrated and you're like 'where are your socks, where are your shoes?!' then you just realise that none of this matters obviously if we don't have our health, then we don't have anything.\"\n\nYou can make a donation to Ronald McDonald charity here.",
