      "text": "Former Shark Tank India personality Ashneer Grover recalled his encounter with Bollywood star Salman Khan, when Ashneer was trying to enlist the actor as a brand ambassador for his company. In his trademark fashion, Ashneer narrated the story of his meeting with Salman, and the opinion that he formed about the actor later.\n\nFormer Shark Tank India personality Ashneer Grover recalled his encounter with Bollywood star Salman Khan, when Ashneer was trying to enlist the actor as a brand ambassador for his company. In his trademark fashion, Ashneer narrated the story of his meeting with Salman, and the opinion that he formed about the actor later.\n\nAshneer appeared on the Vagehra Vagehra podcast recently, where he also spoke about his youth, and briefly touched upon his exit from Shark Tank India.\n\nAsked about his meeting with Salman, which he had spoken about publicly earlier as well, Ashneer said, \u201cUsko humne sponsor rakha tha, uske shoot ke liye mila tha, usko brief karne ke liye company ke baare mein. Teen ghante baitha tha uske saath, uske manager ne bol diya photo nahi khichwani, sir thoda bura maan jaate hain. Maine bola nahi khichwaunga photo, bhaad mein jaa tu, aisi kaunsi heropanti hogayi (We wanted him to endorse our brand, so I met him for the ad shoot and sat with him for three hours. His manager told me that I couldn\u2019t get a picture with him because he might get irritated, and I thought, \u2018Fine, he can go to hell)\u2026\u201d\n\nBut Ashneer also praised Salman\u2019s business acumen, and said that most stars at his level are very intelligent about brand identity. He said, \u201cBut banda smart hai. Logon ko lagta hai ke hawa mein hai, banda genuinely smart hai, usko business samajhta hai, usko branding samajhti hai, usko apni image clear hai. Jab hum ad bana rahe the, usne clear bol diya tha ke mujhe larger than life hi dikhana kyunki maine picture banayi thi Tubelight, woh pit gayi kyunki mujhe usme mandbuddhi dikha diya. Mujhe laga sahi banda hai, yeh sab cheezon ki realisation hai (He\u2019s a smart guy. People might think he\u2019s aloof, but he understands his image. The only thing he told us was to show him as larger than life, because his film Tubelight, in which he played a simpleton, had recently flopped).\u201d\n\nAfter becoming a household name thanks to the hit first season of Shark Tank India, Ashneer won\u2019t be returning for season two, which premiered earlier this week. He said that he \u2018dominated\u2019 season one, and implied that he couldn\u2019t strike a deal for season two.",

      "text": "A heated argument took place between Bigg Boss 16 contestants Archana Gautam and MC Stan inside the house. Taking to Instagram on Tuesday, ColorsTV posted a brief clip of the duo shouting at each other. The video started with Archana screaming at MC Stan, \"Kab tak janta ki khayraat mein rahega yaha pe? Janta aese ghatiya logo ko pasand nahi karti. Iske saare fans ko main bolna chahti hun isne jharu nahi lagayi bhaiyya (For how long will you stay here on the viewers' alms? The audience doesn't like such cheap people. I want to tell all his fans he hasn't cleaned the house).\" (Also Read | Bigg Boss 16: Tina Datta fights with Nimrit Kaur Ahluwalia over dirty kitchen, calls her 'Archana part 2' Watch)\n\nAn angry MC Stan asked, \"Tere baap ka naukar hai kya (Am I your father's servant)?\" and Archana replied, \"Mera baap Bigg Boss hai, uska toh naukar hai na (My father is Bigg Boss, you are his servant, right)?\" He asked, \"Tera baap hai Bigg Boss (Bigg Boss is your father)?\" and made a comment about Archana's mother.\n\nArchana screamed at him, \"Sharam nahi aarahi Bigg Boss ke baare mein aesa bol raha hai? Teri ma hai ya nahi hai? Kaamchor. Bakwas mat kar. Jiske ghar pe rozi roti kha raha hai usi ko bol raha hai aesa (Are you not ashamed of talking about Bigg Boss this way? Do you have a mother or not? Lazy. Don't speak nonsense. You're talking about someone on whom your livelihood is depending)\" MC Stan repeatedly called her 'shemdi (a girl with a runny nose)'.\n\nArchana then screamed laughing, \"See Bigg Boss, he has gone mad. Salman sir se dandh lagegi. Tere jaese ghatiya ko Salman sir dekhenge (Salman sir will punish you. He will take care of a cheap person like you).\" MC Stan said, \"Tu mere ko mat bol ghatiya (Don't call me cheap).\"\n\nArchana responded, \"Tu ghatiya tha, ghatiya hai aur ghatiya rahega. Jo dusre ki maa ki respect nahi karsakta woh ghatiya hai. Tere jaese ghatiya logo ko Salman Khan sir dekhenge. Phut yaha se (You were, are and will remain cheap. One who can't respect another person's mother is cheap. He will take care of a cheap person like you. Leave). The video ended with MC Stan telling Archana again, \"Tere baap ka ghar hai kya, wapis se bol raha hun (I'm asking again, is this your father's house)?\"\n\nBigg Boss, which is now in its 16th season, airs Monday to Friday at 10 pm. The show airs on Saturday and Sunday at 9 pm on ColorsTV. The program is hosted by actor Salman Khan who joined the reality show in its fourth season.",

      "text": "KARACHI: In his six previous Tests Agha Salman had picked up just two wickets across eight innings. So when Pakistan were put in to field by New Zealand in the second Test at the National Stadium here on Monday, the 29-year-old \u2014 in the side as a batting all-rounder \u2014 would have given himself little chance of being the star of the day for the hosts on the opening day.\n\nOn a pitch that had a tinge of green on its sides, Pakistan had opted for three pacers. Salman\u2019s role was largely going to be a supporting one for frontline spinner Abrar Ahmed. Yet, it was the off-break bowler who had the starring role: Salman\u2019s figures of 3-55 till date saw Pakistan pull back New Zealand and leave them at 309-6 at the close.\n\nAnd so, with a wide grin on his face, it was Salman who appeared for the news conference to reflect on the day\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWhen the team was announced, I did realise there will be some responsibility on me as the second spin option,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut I try to contribute as much as I can, whether it\u2019s with the bat or the ball.\u201d\n\nBowled for prolonged spells by skipper Babar Azam, Salman put New Zealand in a spin. His first victim was New Zealand\u2019s century-maker Devon Conway before he followed up with wickets of Daryl Mitchell and Henry Nicholls as the tourists slumped from a commanding position of 234-1 shortly after tea.\n\nHe credited his spin show to the work he\u2019d put in the nets. \u201cI work with [head coach] Saqlain Mushtaq for long time periods during net sessions,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will continue doing this.\u201d\n\nConway\u2019s dismissal came thanks to sharp glovework by Sarfraz Ahmed behind the stumps, the wicket-keeper who made his return to the side for the first time since 2019 in the opening Test of the series. Sarfraz had come under fire for dropped catches in the first game but here, with Pakistan desperately looking for a breakthrough, he held on.\n\n\u201cDropped catches are a part of the game and they can happen to anyone,\u201d said Salman. \u201cI tried to bowl in the good areas, maintain a line and length. I think we also need to give credit to the bowling unit on how we came back in the game.\u201d\n\nWith his three wickets, Salman reached 100 first-class wickets. He didn\u2019t even know about it until he was informed about it by a reporter.\n\n\u201cNow that you tell me, I feel good as it\u2019s a milestone,\u201d he said. And he isn\u2019t in the mood for stopping anytime soon. \u201cIf I get a chance tomorrow, I\u2019ll definitely try to go for a five-wicket haul but I hope the pacers finish them off early.\u201d",

      "text": "Indian businessman Ashneer Grover, the former co-founder and managing director (MD) of the Indian fintech company BharatPe, became a household name after his stint in Shark Tank India season 1. Post the telecast of Shark Tank India, Ashneer Grover turned into a sensation overnight. Many fans of the series started following the entrepreneur. Interestingly, during one of the public events, after season one was concluded, Ashneer revealed that he was not able to get Salman Khan on board for an ad because of a tight budget.\n\nSpeaking of the same event, Grover recently shed more light on the event. For the unversed, Ashneer recently appeared in Vagehra Vagehra podcast, where he also spoke about youngsters while commenting on his exit from Shark Tank India. When the host asked about his meeting with Salman, Ashneer said, \u201cWe wanted him to endorse our brand, so I met him for the ad shoot and sat with him for three hours. His manager told me that I couldn\u2019t get a picture with him because he might get irritated, and I thought, \u2018Fine, he can go to hell\u2019.\u201d\n\nAs the conversation progressed further, Ashneer went on to praise Salman\u2019s business acumen and said that most stars at his level are very intelligent about brand identity. He asserted, \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy. People might think he\u2019s aloof, but he understands his image. The only thing he told us was to show him as larger-than-life, because his film Tubelight, in which he played a simpleton, had recently flopped.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as mentioned earlier, he also briefly touched upon his exit from Shark Tank India 2. He stated that he dominated season 1, and implied that a deal couldn\u2019t be struck for his return.\n\nTalking about the TV show Shark Tank India 2, hosted by Rahul Dua, brings back Anupam Mittal, Aman Gupta, Peyush Bansal, Namita Thapar, and Vineeta Singh.\n\nCatch us for latest Bollywood News, New Bollywood Movies update, Box office collection, New Movies Release , Bollywood News Hindi, Entertainment News, Bollywood Live News Today & Upcoming Movies 2023 and stay updated with latest hindi movies only on Bollywood Hungama.",

      "text": "As one of the country\u2019s highest-paid superstars even today, Salman Khan charges a mind-boggling fee, or/and a share in the profits for a new outside film. And that happens when the film is not a home production of either his brothers Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan, or also brother-in-law Atul Agnihotri and mom Salma Khan as official producers.\n\nBut in his struggling days, though he was the son of the superstar among writers, Salim Khan (of Salim-Javed fame), he would struggle with some ad film assignments and would borrow or get used jeans from actor Kumar Gaurav, who would sometimes even lend Salman his car for dates!\n\nIn an interview after his 55th birthday that fell on December 27, Salman has said that his \u2018funda\u2019 was always hard work. \u201cIf one is successful, one has to work hard. If one is not successful, one still has to work hard. So the hard work never really stops!\u201d he said.\n\nSalman admits that good luck has played a huge role in his life and career, admitting that there are so many bigger than him, and being grateful to God for giving him everything he has today, along with his position. In the beginning, just like his idol Dharmendra just desired \u201cA flat (apartment) and a Fiat (car)\u201d, Salman only wanted to make just a million (Rs. 10 lakh)!\n\nToday, that amount can be rightly termed chicken-feed when we consider his worth and commanded price per film. As director Chandra Barot (who scripted Salim-Javed\u2019s Don) said, \u201cOver 25 years after Don, Salman, who was a kid then, told my son that I would give the three brothers a ride in my convertible car and ten rupees each for ice-cream. This man, who commands crores, still remembers the value of Rs. 10!\u201d\n\nSalman also stated in the interview that many actor friends would make it big one day. But they would be replaced or thrown out. Salman himself had little work in some flop phases before he came back like a storm with Dabangg in 2010. \u201cThat is when I realized that an actor has to give his best to every film!\u201d he said.\n\nSome years ago, his father had confided to me that his son had finally learnt to say \u2018No!\u2019 to people who exploited him into making cameos or signing wrong projects out of sentiment or friendship.\n\nHere, then, is one mega-star who has come up\u2014truly\u2014the hard way!",

      "text": "Actor Salman Khan, who clocked his 57th birthday on Tuesday, had once spoken about wanting children. In an old interview, Salman had said that he wants children but doesn't 'want the mother'. (Also Read | Salman Khan entertains Arpita Khan's kids Ayat and Ahil in Da-Bangg tour BTS video, fans say 'best mama ever'. Watch)\n\nSalman's love for children is evident when he interacts with his nephew Ahil and niece Ayat, children of his sister Arpita Khan and her husband, actor Aayush Sharma. Earlier this year, a video was shared on Instagram in which Salman grooved to the song Allah Duhaai Hai from his film Race 3 and encouraged the children to dance with him.\n\nSpeaking with Mumbai Mirror in 2019, Salman had reacted when said that he loved children. The actor had said, \"(Smiles) I want children, but with children comes the mother. I don\u2019t want the mother, but they need one. But I have a whole village to take care of them. Maybe I can work out a win-win situation for everyone.\"\n\nSalman has been in relationships with several people over the years. He reportedly dated former actor Somy Ali from 1991 to 1999. Salman was also reported to be in relationships with model Sangeeta Bijlani, actors Aishwarya Rai and Katrina Kaif. He is currently rumoured to be dating model Iulia Vantur.\n\nSalman made his breakthrough with a leading role in Maine Pyar Kiya (1989). He went on to feature in many films such as Hum Aapke Hain Koun (1994), Karan Arjun (1995), Biwi No 1 (1999), and Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999).

The film also stars Katrina Kaif in the lead role.",

Salman\u2019s Samaritan face came to the fore only when he founded \u2018 The Being Human Foundation\u2019 in 2007.\n\nBajrangi Bhaijaan\u2018s helping nature has made him more popular among fans and we have also observed in the past that he is helping various newcomers in making a foray into Bollywood. Salman is also seen treating his fans with respect in various videos. \u00a0So, if you are a Salman Khan fan and want to know about Bhaijaan\u2019s contribution to helping others, then keep scrolling.\n\nSalman Khan founded \u2018The Being Human Foundation\u2019 with the objective to provide education and healthcare services to the underprivileged classes in India. The actor is the owner of Being Human- a branded merchandise which primarily funds his \u2018The Being Human Foundation\u2019.\n\nThe foundation supports various projects and performs charitable activities in collaboration with other NGOs also. \u00a0In this write-up, we will let you know how Salman Khan is contributing towards improving the education sector of the country.\n\nThe foundation has been supporting Akshara High School since June 2012. The Salman Khan foundation funds the education of 200 children here. Akshara High School is a not-for-profit neighborhood school located in the western suburbs of Mumbai.\n\nAkshara High School (ICSE Board) began in 2007 with the concept of creating a friendly environment for the education of children in the vicinity of their homes, cited beinghumanonline.com.\n\nAccording to the foundation\u2019s website, Akshara High School has successfully developed as a \u2018Neighborhood School\u2019 in Kandivili, Mumbai over the past years. The school\u2019s motto is to remove the stigma of social inequalities ingrained due to gender, caste, and economic and religious discrimination.\n\nThe fee structure at the school has been kept at a basic minimum so that lower and middle-class people can easily enrol their children in the school.\n\nAseema provides holistic and relevant education to Mumbai\u2019s most neglected children \u2013 children living on the streets, in slums, and in inhuman conditions. Salman\u2019s Being Human foundation has been associated with Aseema since June 2011. Being Human supports around 300 children at Aseema to receive their education.\n\nStarted to empower youth with disabilities, Being Human\u2019s The \u2018Tubelight Project\u2019 is a joint initiative between the foundation, TRRAIN and Rann Neeti Strategic Consultants. Under this project, various skill training centres in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi have been set up and Being Human along with two other partners is planning to start centres pan India.\n\nThe aim of the project is to train differently-abled youth in such a way that they would be able to get employment in the retail sector.\n\nThe aim of the project is to identify lost children in Mumbai and reconnect them with their families. Being Human in association with Rann Neeti Strategic Consultants started the project after getting inspired by the Salman starrer \u2018 Bajrangi Bhaijaan\u2019.\n\nThe Being Bajrangi team works closely with some of the child welfare NGOs and helps them in tracking the missing children. A total of 51 children have been reunited with their families and are now enrolled in schools and other projects in their hometowns, according to the foundation\u2019s website.\n\nBeing Human has started educational resource centres in local Zilla Parishad primary schools to provide basic aids in Arithmetic, English, Marathi, and Health & Social awareness to children from the local community, from grades one to four. The initiative was started in August 2014.\n\nCiting the foundation\u2019s website, a total of 310 children from the local community benefited from these classes alone in the academic year 2016-2017.\n\nCurrently, the foundation is running centres in Waje, Cherivali, Dhamini, Dehrang, Shivansai, Umbroli, and Gadeshwar.\n\nMPSM has been voluntarily working for the upliftment of tribal and farming communities in Maharashtra for the past half-century. Being Human is supporting MPSM\u2019s arithmetic project which would provide skills in basic mathematics to four thousand children from the tribal communities between the age of five and twelve years in Maharashtra. It mainly works in Nashik, Thane, Raigad, Dhule, and Nandurbar.\n\nThe foundation also supports the computer programme run by Maharashtra Prabodhan Seva Mandal in \u00a0Nashik.\n\nThe Salman Khan foundation along with MPSM supports over 1500 Adivasi children who are in primary classes in 65 centres in the Nashik and Palghar districts of Maharashtra.\n\nAccording to the mpsm.in, these classes help the children in learning the basics of language, math, health, art and social perspectives.\n\nTo make teaching-learning more interactive and participatory, Being Human along with MPSM has specially designed materials and curriculum for the upliftment of rural education.\n\nThe teaching-learning materials include videos; large-size picture charts printed on durable flex material; teachers\u2019 handbooks, flip charts and games. These materials are used not only with children in the village-level learning centres.\n\nThe foundation also promotes English learning among rural people.\n\nFoundation has designed and produced a set of 19 animated video capsules along with a guide for facilitators.\n\nSalman Khan\u2019s foundation is also working on several other projects to boost the education system of the country.

      "text": "For Gen Z, Salman Khan is Bhai\u2014the tough, poker-faced muscled man, who can fight off an entire army of goons. This image brimming with machismo almost cannot be connected with the romantic idealist version of Salman who ruled the 90s. If Shah Rukh Khan was the smooth-talking Rahul or Raj, ironically, Salman was the good son, brother and husband Prem, even though off-screen, he was the quintessential bad boy of Bollywood.\n\nFor Gen Z, Salman Khan is Bhai\u2014the tough, poker-faced muscled man, who can fight off an entire army of goons. This image brimming with machismo almost cannot be connected with the romantic idealist version of Salman who ruled the 90s. If Shah Rukh Khan was the smooth-talking Rahul or Raj, ironically, Salman was the good son, brother and husband Prem, even though off-screen, he was the quintessential bad boy of Bollywood.\n\nSalman Khan\u2019s career can be encapsulated in several phases\u2014-from the 90s, to the experimental early 2000s and finally the hardened Bhai we know today.\n\nThe many Prems, comedy and action of the 90s\n\nWhile Salman Khan made his debut with the 1988 film Biwi Ho To Aisi in a supporting role, it was his leading role in Sooraj Barjatya\u2019s romantic drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1988) that brought him the spotlight. In the first iteration of Prem, Salman played the badly-behaved son of a rich family, who changes his ways after meeting the simple Suman (Bhagyashree). However, as always Bollywood parents are the biggest obstacles and after much heartache, Prem leaves aside his life of luxury to prove himself to Suman\u2019s father. Despite the success of the film, Salman later admitted that he did not get work for 4-5 months, till his father Salim Khan intervened and requested GP Sippy to sign Salman for Patthar Ke Phool.\n\nAfter enjoying a few moderate successes, Salman once again scrabbled to stardom after playing Prem (again) in Sooraj Barjatya\u2019s Hum Aapke Hain Koun (1994). This time, Prem wasn\u2019t the arrogant or badly-behaved fellow who needed a woman to change his ways\u2014-he was already the image of perfection. He was the ideal son, brother and cutesy lover, who was willing to sacrifice the love of his life for his brother. The film emerged as one of the biggest blockbusters of the year and Salman had established himself as one of the leading stars. He also starred in the comedy Andaz Apna Apna as Prem, a man trying to win over a rich woman\u2019s heart, while getting entangled in an absurd comedy of errors. The film failed at the box office, but attained cult status over the years. It also proved Salman\u2019s prowess at slapstick comedy. For the era, he melded in well. Towards the end of the \u201890s, Salman played another Prem in Sooraj Barjatya\u2019s Hum Saath Saath Hain. This Prem was the serious and quiet virtuous type.\n\nYet, while Prems dominated his \u201890s career, Salman tried various roles\u2014he starred in the action film Karan Arjun, where he played a vengeful reincarnated son alongside SRK. He also starred in David Dhawan\u2019s comedies, Judwaa and Biwi No. 1, establishing himself as an all-round star. The \u201890s also saw him accepting the roles of a defeated lover, including his surprise cameo in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai where he loses Kajol to SRK and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, where Aishwarya Rai leaves him for Ajay Devgn. Salman checked all the boxes of the era\u2014the over-the-top comedy, action and the run-around-the-trees romance.\n\nSalman Khan experimented wildly in 2000s, albeit without much success. In 2001, Salman starred in Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, which addressed the issue of surrogacy\u2014a rare topic for Hindi films then. In 2002, he featured in the disastrous Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam, that refused to take off despite featuring Madhuri Dixit and Shah Rukh Khan\u2014it was a reminder that what worked in the 90s wasn\u2019t going to be successful in the 2000s. And then came Tere Naam in 2003, which gave way to the army of Bhai fans with parted hair and net vests. The romantic drama, which also faced much criticism, saw Salman showcasing his broken and vulnerable side, something he hadn\u2019t quite done before. In the middle, there were other forgettable films including Tumko Na Bhool Na Paayenge. But Salman wasn\u2019t going to give up, he still wanted to make his own image for the 2000s. So, he tried comedies like No Entry and Mujhse Shaadi Karoge, which worked well. In a rare move, there was the dark and disturbing Kyun Ki with Kareena Kapoor, where he played the role of a patient in a mental health facility.\n\nWith 2009 film Wanted, Salman Khan\u2019s game changed for good. Salman worked with Prabhudheva for the first time in Wanted, which was a remake of the Telugu blockbuster Pokiri. Filled with over-the top massy dialogues, and unique dance steps, Salman carved a new image for himself and became the symbol of machismo. The film crossed Rs 100 crore at the box office, and it was his first Eid release, kicking off a tradition that his fans would soon eagerly start waiting for.\n\nThere was no looking back after this\u2014gone were the days of mushy, cutesy or effusive dialogues, it was the time for one-liners that would inevitably make it to bhai fan tweets. So, fans began spouting lines like \u201cEk baar jo maine commitment kar di\u201d from Wanted, followed by the likes of \u201cMujhpe ek ehsaan karna, mujhpe koi ehsaan mat karna\u201d, \u201cZindagi mein teen cheezein kabhi underestimate mat karna \u2013 I, Me, aur Myself\u201d and \u201cSwagat nahi karoge hamara\u201d.\n\nSoon, the Dabangg franchise followed, where Salman Khan played a rowdy cop and then along came the Tiger franchise. Now he was the super spy who could beat up people single-handedly but didn\u2019t have much control over his heart when it came to Katrina Kaif\u2019s Zoya. The era of Rs 300 crore blockbusters for Salman dawned, and stayed with Bajrangi Bhaijaan in 2015. Salman remained Bhai regardless of whether his films worked or not, even if they were appalling failures like Race 3. He remained indifferent as he knew that his worst films still minted money at the box office, and he could care less about critics. Salman hasn\u2019t witnessed too many successes of late despite the tough-and-gruff actioners, but at this point in his career, it doesn\u2019t affect his fans or his stardom, least of all him.",

      "text": "Daring to disagree with Jean De La Fontaine, sadness does not fly away on the wings of time. At least, not always. If the ticking of the clock actually carried some magic, the past 12 years would have been enough to pierce through the blanket of silence commemorating a fallen warrior: Salman Taseer.\n\nAs his bullet-riddled body was lowered into an early grave, hopes for a tolerant, pluralistic Pakistan, as envisioned by our founding father, hurried to join. After all, there was only a limited number of lions our soil could take credit for. Not many can find the courage within and thunder, \u201cIf I do not stand by my conscience, then who will?\u201d\n\nThe brazen display of support in a jail in Sheikhupura when he had comforted a woman said to be living on borrowed time had managed to leave even people in his close circles a bit surprised.\n\nAsia Bibi, then accused of blasphemy, sat at the heart of the stinging controversy that began from burned effigies, twisted-turved around heated declarations on mainstream media and ended with a policeman becoming a law unto himself.\n\nHis friends were quick to remind him how life had never been easy for the \u201cwesternised\u201d ideals of well-to-do liberals in the largely conservative country. That the social stature would not always provide the cover echoed far and wide. But both sides grossly underestimated how invested Taseer had become in the fight mandated by the white in his much-revered flag as well as the teachings of the book he was accused of turning his back on. The barrage of stones continued and his brusque, unrelenting vigour followed. But he could not play with fire forever.\n\nNo matter how high he sat in the federation\u2013that too, in the largest, somewhat urbanised province\u2013he could not be allowed to get away with poking the ugly bear of irrationality, point fingers at the pernicious baton and get away unharmed. The prejudice must have made up its mind at the first glimpse of the warm exchange between the former governor and the anathematised. How dare he defy the status quo? How could his scruples steal the limelight from the injustice? The course correction needed a sacrifice, for sure. Blood, the bigoted had demanded. Blood, the astray would be fed.\n\nTo their misfortune, Mr Taseer tugged at their masks from the ferocious claws of death. His bravery and the subsequent unleashing of hellfire very publicly spelt out the end of reason and pulled back the drapes off the moderation facade practised by the ruling elite. Repackaging their vile abuse of authority in a glossier cover of religion would not make it smell any sweeter. \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name\u201d anyway? The chaos that prevailed soon afterwards was assumed to nip the revolucion in the bud. But the forces that be forgot how the journey must go one. The hands have changed and the torch shines far less brightly. Quite reasonably, optimism might be difficult to hold on to because we cannot all be unafraid of holding the fort. Still, every faint ray of light standing up to protect the weaklings and take an unconventional public position is, in one way or another, a grand homage to the memories and principles of Salman Taseer. You may have left us, sir, but your perseverance as the fountainhead of a better Pakistan lives one. Just like you, \u201chum ne (bhi) gulshan k tahfuz ki qasm khae hae.\u201d (we, too, are ready to defend the homeland)",

      "text": "Pan-India superstar Prabhas is one of the biggest bankable stars in the entertainment industry. Since the success of the Baahubali series, the actor\u2019s popularity skyrocketed. More than his films, he often makes headlines over rumored affairs with multiple actresses, including Kriti Sanon and Anushka Shetty.\n\nWhile none of the speculations have been confirmed, fans have been wondering when will the superstar get married. The Saaho actor has now opened up on his marriage during a conversation with Unstoppable With NBK. Scroll down to know more.\n\nAs the second season of Unstoppable With NBK kick-started, the first part of the episode was dominated by discussions about Prabhas\u2019 hush-hush romantic life. Nandamuri Balakrishna began grilling the Telugu superstar about possibly tying the knot, but he didn\u2019t cave in.\n\nAs reported by News 18 report, the Adipurush actor replied, \u201cNo idea, sir. I don\u2019t know yet. I will definitely get married, but it\u2019s not written in my destiny yet.\u201d NBK then went on to ask how he manages to deal with his mother\u2019s pressure since every mother wants to see their children settled in their life.\n\nPrabhas shared that his sister and sister-in-law live close by. So, that is how they are managing for now. \u201cLater\u2026 I mean, it should be destiny. What is in our hands?\u201d he added. Nandamuri Balakrishna went on to reveal that Sharwanand was on the show, and he was also asked the same question. The latter said that he would tie the knot when Prabhas does.\n\nUpon hearing this, the Rebel star replied, \u201cThen I should say I\u2019ll get married after Salman Khan.\u201d\n\nOne of the key highlights of the episode was Ram Charan\u2019s call after which it was a laughing riot. NBK and Ram Charan took turns pulling the leg of the Saaho actor. Balakrishna asked the RRR actor to reconfirm if Prabhas was single as he was having a hard time believing it.\n\nMust Read: Samantha Is No More A Part Of Varun Dhawan\u2019s Citadel Remake?

Fellow auteur Devashish Makhija\u2019s \u201cJoram\u201d will world premiere at Rotterdam in 2023. It stars Manoj Bajpayee, who also headlines Apoorv Singh Kark\u2019s \u201cBandaa.\u201d Nawazuddin Siddiqui essays a transgender role in \u201cHaddi\u201d and also stars in \u201cLove is Blind.\u201d\n\nHighlights of the Zee Studios Tamil-language slate include Muthaiya\u2019s \u201cKather Basha Endra Muthuramalingam,\u201d starring Arya; a landmark film from a superstar actor, details of which are under wraps; and Kishor Pandurang Belekar\u2019s dialogue-free film \u201cGandhi Talks,\u201d with music by A.

In 2020 the studios strategy pivoted to dovetail into the larger organization play. We were already a leader in Marathi films, we added Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malyalam and Punjabi into the regional mix. The initial response has been very encouraging with films like \u201cValimai\u201d (Tamil), \u201cBangarraju\u201d (Telugu), \u201cDharamveer\u201d (Marathi) performing well not just at the box office but also in driving subscriber growth on the OTT [streaming] platform and delivering healthy ratings on television,\u201d Zee Studios chief business officer Shariq Patel told Variety.\u00a0\u201cThe strategy remains to make films across languages. We have a mix of tentpole and art house films and each film will have a unique marketing and release plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am often asked by directors and producers as to what kind of films I am looking to greenlight at any point of time. My answer is always the same. First is I have no idea what will click, in this business no one does, despite claims of knowing. Secondly as a studio I have to do it all, so for every \u2018Thunivu\u2019 starring Ajith Kumar or a \u2018King of Kotha\u2019 with Dulquer we will have a \u2018Mrs. Chatterjee v/s Norway\u2019 with Rani Mukerji or \u2018Joram\u2019 with Manoj Bajpayee,\u201d Patel added. \u201cWe need to make it all, we work with Anil Sharma (\u2018Gadar 2\u2019) and also with Anurag Kashyap (\u2018Kennedy\u2019). We just have to ensure each film we are working on is budgeted correctly and the economics make sense. In addition we also have a series \u2018Brown\u2019 directed by Abhinay Deo starring Karisma Kapoor which is in post production and we propose to make more such premium series in the coming year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have segmented our films according to size/scale/genre. And each film\u2019s marketing and release strategy is crafted in a unique way. While a majority of them are for India theatrical release, we have made conscious investments in a set of films which we hope to take to the world via festivals i.e. \u2018Joram\u2019 by Devashish Makhija, \u2018Gandhi Talks,\u2019 a silent film starring Vijay Sethupathy and Arvind Swami, \u2018Kennedy\u2019 by Anurag Kashyap are a few examples. We aspire to establish Zee Studios as the preeminent studio for Indian films,\u201d Patel said.\n\nZee Studios, which scored one of the biggest 2022 hits with \u201cThe Kashmir Files,\u201d currently has Kannada-language film \u201cVedha,\u201d starring Shiva Rajkumar on release.",

Since then, the Jazan City Track and the Farasan Islands Track were approved as tourist hiking routes.\n\nThe Heritage Village, meanwhile, is an important tourist attraction. During a tour of the site by an Arab News team, the village\u2019s Director Mohammed Ali said that it was popular due to its architectural style and its cultural heritage.\n\nThere are several historic buildings made of stone and mud that detail the historical way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Jazan region has established a name for itself globally in every sphere, be it business, development, or tourism. In the Al-Raith governorate of the Global Islands, for example, there is one of the biggest model gardens in the world,\u201d Ali said.\n\n\u201cIn the mountainous governorates, coffee is grown, which UNESCO has called one of the best products in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ali, the village, which spans 7,000 acres, is where the customs and traditions of the mountains, Tihama, and maritime environments come together in one location.\n\nIn the village marketplace, local resident Hamouda Hussain is one of a number of women selling traditional products.\n\n\u201cI have loved sewing since I was a child, and I am here selling my products, which are popular traditional clothes,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cI also make oud mixtures and incense for the body. I see many tourists who come from everywhere to the heritage village and buy my products.\n\n\u201cTourists flock more in the winter, spring break, founding day, and national day,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter visiting the village, visitors can take a ferry to the Farasan Islands, whose reserve is known for its diverse ecosystems and rare wildlife was included in the \u201cMan and the Biosphere Program,\u201d a UNESCO initiative.\n\nThe ferry captain\u2019s assistant, Yousef Al-Seeni, said that nothing makes him happier than seeing visitors from all over the world come to the islands.\n\n\u201cWe have received many tourists from around the world, and they are pleased with us because the sailing time is only an hour,\u201d Al-Seeni said. As a result, they enjoy us as well as the view of the island and dolphins, as well as the opportunity to indulge in their favorite pastimes like diving, fishing, and a variety of sports like hiking and tasting the delectable seafood.\u201d\n\nJazan and Farasan are famous for the trade in fish and pearls that are sold and exported to countries around the world due to the abundance of coastal beaches, which are rich in fish, shellfish, and seashells.",

Agha Salman, in particular, was the wrecker-in-chief, bagging a three-wicket haul for 55 runs in 20 overs.\n\nSalman dismissed centurion Devon Conway and broke the 100-run partnership between the left-handed opener and skipper Kane Williamson. Salman picked up two more wickets in the form of Henry Nicholls and Daryl Mitchell. His dismissal of Mitchell, however, attracted maximum eyeballs.\n\nSalman bowled a peach of a delivery to clean up Mitchell in the 69th over of New Zealand\u2019s first innings. The spinner went for a classical off-spin which pitched right on the money to draw the right-hand batter forward. As Mitchell tried to defend the ball, the red cherry pierced through the tiny gap between the bat and the pad, and hit the stumps.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nApart from Salman, Naseem Shah also impressed one and all with his disciplined bowling throughout the opening day. He drew the first blood in the form of Tom Latham before joining hands with Salman to pick two more scalps, triggering a batting collapse of the Black Caps. Naseem bagged three scalps for 46 runs in 18.4 overs.\n\nEarlier, after electing to bat first, the visitors started strongly as Conway stitched together crucial stands of 134 and 100 with Latham and Williamson. It was Conway\u2019s fourth Test century, and he also surpassed the 1000-run benchmark.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good ride so far. I\u2019ve only played a handful of Test games, so it\u2019s nice to get the opportunity to play and contribute to the team. It was nice batting out there with Tommy Latham and Kane, we managed to form some good partnerships,\u201d Conway told the reporters.",

While we eagerly wait for\u00a0our favorite celebrities to appear and face tough questions from him, we look back at one of the most trending and popular episodes from his show. It featured one of the biggest stars in Bollywood, Salman Khan. He faced all the charges and was 'acquitted' by the 'Janta Ki Adalat' in 2019.\n\nRajat Sharma recalled how Salman walked onto the stage, looking all buffed. Sharma said Salman assured him that he will answer all questions posed to him. Salman fulfilled his promise. Bollywood's 'Bhaijaan' was his most candid self on Aap Ki Adalat. Sharma said that Salman answered all the questions regarding his professional and personal life\u00a0and controversies with grace and later came up to him, hugged him, and said , \"Sir kamaal kar diya.\"\n\nAap Ki Adalat has been iconic in more ways than one. Over its 30-year journey with over 1100 episodes aired, it has seen over 190 celebrity guests including the President of India, Prime Minister of India, Defence Ministers, Cabinet Ministers and Chief Ministers of various states and entertainment industry stars.",

His cold war with Vivek Oberoi has been the longest ever seen in tinsel town so far.\n\nBoth the actors had dated Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and have never resolved their tiff. Back in 2003, the Saathiya actor called a press conference revealing that he received 41 calls from a drunk Salman abusing him and threatening to kill him over his closeness with Aishwarya.\n\nVivek Oberoi\u2019s this move turned out to be detrimental for him. His acting career took a nose dive. Despite Vivek apologising to Salman Khan on several occasions, the superstar never forgave him. In fact, Dabangg Khan even took a dig at Vivek during his show.\n\nSalman once hosted a game show Dus Ka Dum that ran for nearly three seasons. In the first season of the game show, former cricketers Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh appeared as the first celebrity guests. During the show, the Tiger 3 actor narrated how he once had a hamstring injury while running on sets.\n\nA jovial Harbajan Singh inquired if he was running after Vivek Oberoi. Salman couldn\u2019t help but laugh at Harbhajan\u2019s query and then added, \u201cVivek Oberoi\u2026.chodiye unko. Unki zindagi unko jeene dein aaraam se nahin toh khaamakhaan choti ho jayegi\u201d\n\nIn the same episode, Salman Khan asked Yuvraj about his favourite actress, and the cricketer intentionally took Katrina Kaif\u2019s name, leaving Salman blushing. In return, Salman too stated that even he likes her. Talking about Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif, they have worked together in many films in the past. Their last film together was Bharat which collected over Rs 200 crore at the box office.\n\nNow both Salman and Katrina are once again teaming up for Tiger 3, which is touted to release in 2023.\n\nMust Read:\u00a0Shehnaaz Gill Car Collection: From Owning 1.2 Crore Worth Jaguar To Mercedes Benz At 46 Lakhs, Punjab Ki Katrina Kaif\u2019s Swanky Rides Will Leave You Awestruck!",

He was talking to Vicky Kaushal and Kiara Advani who were visited his reality game show Bigg Boss 16 as guests. (Also read: Akshay Kumar's emotional old video makes Salman Khan share a message, he reacts)\n\nVicky and Kiara were promoting their new film Govinda Naam Mera on the show. Vicky asked Salman Khan, \u201cDid any girl use any pick up line on you? And if yes, what\u2019s the worst pick-up line you have heard?\u201d\n\nSalman replied jokingly as he laughed, \u201cPick up ka toh pata nahi lekin ladki ne drop zaroor kiya hai mujhe (I am not sure about the pick-up but girls have certainly dropped me).\u201d Vicky and Kiara also joined him laughing. The host then added, \u201cWell, to be honest, I don\u2019t remember any such pick up line.\u201d\n\nDuring their visit to the Bigg Boss house, Vicky and Kiara donned the role of radio jockeys and asked the contestants various questions. The actors also dedicated songs to the contestants.\n\nSalman Khan has been rumoured to date many girls in his life. These include Aishwarya Rai, Sangeeta Bijlani, Katrina Kaif, Iulia Vantur, among many others. Salman, however, has never spoken about his relationships.\n\nDirected by Shashank Khaitan, Govinda Naam Mera also stars Bhumi Pednekar and Renuka Shahane in lead roles. The film is a murder mystery and it landed online on Disney+ Hotstar on December 16.\n\nVicky will next be seen in Anand Tiwari's upcoming film along side Triptii Dimri. The film is yet-to-be-titled film and is set for a theatrical release on July 28, 2023. He also has the ambitious project, Meghna Gulzar's Sam Bahadur lined up for next. Vicky essays the role of Sam Manekshaw, who was the Chief of Army Staff during the India-Pakistan war in 1971, in the film.\n\nSalman Khan was recently seen in a cameo in Chiranjeevi's Telugu film Godfather.

      "text": "Actor Salman Khan has showered love on actor Akshay Kumar as he shared a throwback emotional video of the latter. Taking to his Instagram Stories on Friday, Salman Khan posted the clip in which Akshay's sister Alka Bhatia sent him an audio message on a reality show, leaving the actor emotional. (Also Read | Emotional Akshay Kumar cries at sister's message for him on Superstar Singer)\n\nSharing the clip, Salman captioned it, \"I just came across something that I thought that I must share with everyone. God bless you Akki, truly amazing, felt so good seeing this. Keep fit, keep working and may god always be with you brother. @akshaykumar.\"\n\nReplying to Salman, Akshay re-shared the post on his Instagram Stories. He wrote, \"Really touched by your message @beingsalmankhan. Bohot achha laga (I felt very good). God bless you too. Shine on (hug emoji).\"\n\nThe emotional clip was from the singing reality show Superstar Singer 2 where Akshay arrived during the promotions of his family entertainer film Raksha Bandhan, earlier this year. In the clip, Alka thanked Akshay for being there for her.\n\nAddressing the actor as Raju, a part of her message said in Punjabi was, \"You stood beside me at all times, good and bad. From being a father, and friend to a brother, you played all roles for me. Thank you for everything.\"\n\nSalman and Akshay have so far featured in two films--Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Jaan-E-Mann.

      "text": "In August this year Salman Rushdie was stabbed multiple times. The novelist survived the attack, to the outward relief of the West. Prominent figures from the world of religion, politics and the arts offered their unqualified support to Rushdie as he lay in a New York hospital, recovering from the 12 knife wounds to his body.\n\nThe mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, whose city in recent years has been targeted on several occasions by Islamist extremists, tweeted her support for Rushdie, a writer she described as \u2018inspiring and a free man\u2019.\n\nThe rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, Chems-Eddine Hafiz,published an open letter to Rushdie, in which he expressed his horror at the attack and\u00a0declared:\n\n\u2018I am writing to you from France, the country of writers and artists, of openness and free conscience. I have the honour of leading one of its lanterns, the Grand Mosque of Paris, from which we spread to the whole world a message of peace, tolerance and brotherhood, that of true Islam.\u2019\n\nThis week the rector issued a statement about another of the West\u2019s literary giants, the French writer Michel Houellebecq, winner of the 2010\u00a0Goncourt prize (France\u2019s highest literary honour) and one of the very few contemporary novelists courageous enough to write critically of Islam.\n\nHouellebecq\u2019s 2015 book,\u00a0Submission, depicted an Islamic political party winning the 2022 presidential election and, prior to publication, it caused outrage among the Parisian bien-pensants. It was published on January 7, a couple of hours before the staff of the satirical magazine\u00a0Charlie Hebdo\u00a0were slaughtered by Islamist gunmen in their Paris office.\n\nIn this week\u2019s\u00a0statement, Chems-Eddine Hafiz let it be known that he has filed a legal complaint against Houellebecq because of what he described as his \u2018very grave comments he made about Muslims in France\u2019 in a recent\u00a0interview\u00a0with the left-wing philosopher Michel Onfray. In November the pair \u2013\u00a0two of the last remaining genuine intellectuals in France \u2013 had a wide-ranging conversation and Islam was one subject they discussed.\n\nAt one point Houellebecq touched on the theme of\u00a0Submission, envisaging a France that is riven by violent factions. \u2018When entire territories are under Islamic control, I think that acts of resistance will take place,\u2019 said the novelist. \u2018There will be attacks and shootings in mosques, in caf\u00e9s frequented by Muslims, in short Bataclan in reverse.\u2019 Hafiz took exception to Houellebecq\u2019s hypothesis of future terrorist attacks by non-Muslims, overlooking the horrendous incident last week in Paris when a Frenchman who\u00a0said\u00a0he \u2018hated\u2019 foreigners allegedly shot dead three Kurds.\n\nThe rector also took offence to Houellebecq\u2019s claim that that the \u2018wish of the native French population\u2026 is not that Muslims assimilate, but that they stop robbing and assaulting them. Or else, another solution, that they leave.\u2019\n\nThese are controversial remarks but this is Michel Houellebecq, a man routinely depicted at home and abroad as the \u2018enfant terrible\u2019\u00a0of French literature. When he received the Legion of Honour from Emmanuel Macron in 2019, the novelist was described by one broadcaster as a writer who \u2018continues to provoke outrage with blunt, often pungent comments on religion, politics and society.\u2019\n\nHafiz is\u00a0supported\u00a0in his complaint by Anne Hidalgo, who is less willing to champion Houellebecq\u2019s right to freedom of expression than she does Rushdie\u2019s. The same of course applies to the rector, who no longer seems to take pride in living in a country of \u2018openness and free conscience\u2019.\n\nHouellebecq\u2019s comments were controversial but were they, as the rector claims, \u2018inciteful\u2019? The novelist painted a characteristically bleak picture but at no point did he encourage non-Muslims to attack Muslims. He was just being his usual pessimistic self.\n\nAs an op-ed in\u00a0Le Figaro\u00a0put it\u00a0this week, \u2018as far as we know, pessimism is not yet an offence or a crime.\u2019\n\nBy filing a legal complaint, Hafiz has not only revealed his hypocrisy but he has reinforced the main thrust of Houellebecq\u2019s argument: that Islam is incompatible with the liberal West. The rector would have been better advised to challenge the novelist to a public debate, a meeting of minds in a spirit of his cherished \u2018openness and free conscience\u2019.\n\nInstead, he appears to want Houellebecq silenced and any future debate on Islam and French Muslims censored.\n\nIt would be a terrible day for free speech in France if Hafiz won his suit against Houellebecq but, more disturbingly,\u00a0Le Figaro\u00a0fears that \u2018this criminal complaint makes Houellebecq a target\u2026and [he] risks becoming the next Salman Rushdie.\u2019\n\nFollowing the publication of\u00a0Submission, and the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Houellebecq was placed under police protection. In an interview the same year he said of the targeting of the magazine\u2019s staff, \u2018I was sad, but I wasn\u2019t surprised.\u2019\n\nWhat a tragedy for the West if we were ever forced to speak in similar terms of\u00a0Michel Houellebecq.",

Prakash said he doesn\u2019t look at Salman as an actor, but as a prank-loving, goofy child.\n\nSpeaking to Lallantop, the actor said, \u201cI don\u2019t look at him as an actor, I look at him as a pranky kid. He will never get old. He has no filter. He is not criminal-minded. I have done two films with him, I like his company. Wo kisi se darta nahi hai (He is not scared of anybody).\u201d\n\nPrakash Raj then went on to state that Salman Khan arrives to set late, and works at his own pace, because he knows his market, and he is comforted in the knowledge of having a considerable fan base. As the actor made these remarks, his Mukhbir co-star Adil Hussain was seen laughing.\n\nNot so long ago, Prakash had opened up about losing work owing to his political bluntness. \u201cIt is getting affected. Now, some people don\u2019t work with me not because they have been told not to. But because they are worried \u2018they\u2019 may not approve. I am strong and rich enough to lose all that. I always feel my fear will be somebody\u2019s power,\u201d the actor had told Hindustan Times.\n\nPrakash Raj is currently seen in the ZEE5 espionage series Mukhbir.\n\nMeanwhile, Salman Khan is looking forward to the release of the action-packed Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. The film marks the Bollywood debut of Shehnaaz Gill, and also features Pooja Hegde.",

      "text": "On Riteish Deshmukh\u2019s birthday, actor Salman Khan took to his Instagram handle and teased fans to a glimpse of his special appearance in Ved. He will be joining Riteish on the song Ved Lavlay. The film marks Riteish Deshmukh\u2019s directorial debut in Marathi films and also has Genelia D\u2019Souza. Also read: Riteish Deshmukh pens emotional note for Salman Khan\n\nSharing a sneak-peak from the song, Salman Khan wrote, \u201cBhau cha birthday aahe -@riteishd Gift to Banta hai (It\u2019s Riteish\u2019s birthday, so here\u2019s a gift). Enjoy.\u201d The song features Salman and Ritesh matching movies with a hook step of the dance. The Mumbaiya ambience of the song promises a peppy track with Salman jumping from a balcony and landing on a truck to sitting on a cycle.\n\nInterestingly, in one of the scenes, Salman is seen dancing with a glass kept inside his pocket. For the unversed, earlier this year he made news when stepped out with a glass tucked inside the pocket of his pants. The full song will be out soon.\n\nReacting to the first look, a fan replied in the comment section, \u201cGlass in pocket... it's really Salman Khan's style.\u201d \u201cThe best gift we can say,\u201d added another one. Someone also shared, \u201cBollywood ka trend fir bhai hi laynge (Salman Khan will set the trends in Bollywood).\u201d\n\nEarlier, Riteish had shared pictures of them from the set of Ved. He captioned them with a note thanking Salman. The pictures showed Riteish and Salman laughing as they shot for the film. \u201cAs we celebrate Ashadi Ekadashi, I wish you all a life filled happiness, love and prosperity. On this auspicious day it thrills me to say that with your kind blessings I have completed filming my first directorial Marathi movie \u2018Ved\u2019 (Madness, Crazy, Passion). This road had its own challenges but when you are surrounded with people that have your back, forward is the only way you can go. One such person is my dearest \u2018Salman Bhau.\u2019\u201d He said in a post.\n\nSalman had previously done a cameo in Marathi film, Lai Bhaari, which marked Riteish Deshmukh\u2019s acting debut. The film also had Genelia in a cameo appearance in a song. Meanwhile, Ved will be her first full-length Marathi film. It is slated to release on December 30.",

But two months later, it\u2019s still unclear what those \u201cconsequences,\u201d if any, will be. Much of that can perhaps be attributed to the other geopolitical waters the White House has to navigate, not least out of Moscow and Beijing. But there are other forces at work: Just as Riyadh has managed to turn shifting geopolitical contours to its own benefit, MBS has managed to consolidate his own power base in Riyadh\u2014and has extended his networks of influence abroad, especially among key sectors across the West.\n\nLook at what\u2019s taken place domestically over the past year. In September, MBS officially became Saudi Arabia\u2019s prime minister, effectively formalizing his status as the de facto head of the kingdom. Any questions about his role\u2014or his future\u2014in the Saudi governance structure have been effectively eliminated. So too have any domestic threats to his power. And as seen with Saudi Arabia\u2019s mass execution of over 80 men in a single day earlier this year, any questions about MBS\u2019s penchant for violence have likewise ceased.\n\nAbroad, MBS has overseen a wholesale effort to recast his country\u2019s image from a bastion of intolerance and extremism to one that is far more chic, and far more appealing, than previously imagined. Working with Western consultancy firms like McKinsey and public relations firms like Edelman, Saudi Arabia under MBS has run a master class in \u201creputation laundering\u201d and in using Western services to transform its identity from that of a kleptocratic dictatorship into a regime ready to be welcomed into polite society. Obviously, many other odious states are engaged in efforts to whitewash their reputations, but even among the broader world of dictatorships, MBS and the Saudi regime stand apart.",

In a conversation with Hindustan Times, she said, \u201cOur whole team knew stakes were high and they did not take the audience for granted.\u201d Sharing her experience of working with the ensemble cast, including Naveen Kasturia, Arunabh Kumar, Jitendra Kumar and Abhay Mahajan, Ridhi says, \u201cYou cannot fit me in a box. I am happy to work with people who are original. I think what am I being if not original? Everyone can act and be pretty. I too don\u2019t take the audience for granted and say \u2018TV has given me fans, I am set!\u2019\u201dAlso read: Ridhi Dogra says \u2018You can\u2019t be an actor if you are not observant\u2019\n\nRidhi describes Pitchers as a story of dreamers. When asked what is her dream, the actor says, \u201cActing is my dream. I am still working on my dreams and I am where I want to be.\u201d While Ridhi is working on her dream, yet another dream of her's \u2013 working with Shah Rukh Khan \u2013 came true with filmmaker Atlee\u2019s upcoming Jawan. Besides this, Ridhi is also looking forward to 2023 with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif\u2019s big-budget action flick, Tiger 3, and also Asur 2.\n\n\u201cI had a great time during both Tiger 3 and Jawan. Both are big multi-starrer films. When you are involved in such big projects it is like a jigsaw puzzle.\u201d Ridhi feels signing up for big projects isn\u2019t about proving her caliber. \u201cThe reason for doing these films isn\u2019t that I feel if I do this certain film then I will be somewhere. I have done these for myself. I personally wanted to work with Maneesh Sharma,\u201d Ridhi said.\n\nRidhi and Tiger 3 director's friendship goes back a long time. She says, \u201cWhen I got to know that Maneesh is directing Tiger 3, I wanted to do it. It\u2019s like meeting an old friend. I have never chased a film because I want to work with people. My intention is not to be a part of something bigger than myself. I much rather be part of projects where people will be interested in having me on board.\u201d\n\nAll big opportunities open new avenues, but what about the add pressure? Ridhi, who will be seen in supporting roles in both Shah Rukh and Salman Khan-starrer, says, \u201cIt\u2019s also scary. These big-budget films, made for these people. I am used to doing a certain quality of work. If I am on a project then I want to take it on my shoulder. It's actually a personal risk to work in Jawan, Tiger 3.\"\n\nIf Ridhi agreed for Tiger 3 because of personal reasons, then what about Jawan? \u201cI have done Jawan for Shah Rukh,\" she blushes. \u201cI am one of those million people who have been shaped by Shah Rukh. As a 10-year-old I have sat and read his every interview in magazines.\u201d Ridhi also recalls rejecting Jawan immediately. \u201cMy initial reaction to Jawan was no. This is because to come in front of him you want to be the best. But the director was kind. He met me twice and convinced me to come on board. I respect Atlee a lot. He is a genius. I am not allowed to talk about the film but I hope to get bigger opportunities beside him,\u201d added the actor.\n\nFor Ridhi, Shah Rukh is love. She describes him, \u201cHe is everything we all know. After I met him for the first time, I was unable to talk. He would talk to everybody on the sets. And, I was speechless. Even when I was sitting next to him I couldn\u2019t talk to him. I mean where do I start? I cannot normalise him. I would want to keep him as my idol than my friend.\u201d\n\nBeing someone who has now worked with Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, when asked how the two differ from each other, Ridhi laughs and says, \u201cThere are so many people who worked with both, don\u2019t put me under the bus. Honestly, I spent more time with Shah Rukh than with Salman. I am really nobody to say what\u2019s different. The only difference is that Shah Rukh is from Delhi and Salman is a true Bombay boy. Salman has swag and energy, Shah Rukh is lovable and warm.\u201d",

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s popularity has increased manifold recently in the wake of his scheduled visit to Pakistan, that had to be postponed due to a protest by a political party that was ousted from power.\n\nIt was expected that the Crown Prince would have announced hefty investment in Pakistan and fiscal assistance for the country. It has been hinted that he would be visiting Pakistan soon.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki met with Nawaz Akhtar who also displayed a charming portrait of the Crown Prince on the back of his truck. Nawaz Akhtar brought his truck, carrying Saud Crown Prince\u2019s portrait, into the Saudi Embassy compound, where he was received by the Saudi envoy. Ambassador Nawaf Al-Malki appreciated his gesture of affection for Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman and Saudi Kingdom and presented him a souvenir.",

As a matter of fact, not just Salman, but Google CEO Sundar Pichai, American singer Charlie Puth and several other major accounts have been hacked.\n\nAs per several media reports, the hackers, who claim to have stolen the data of nearly 400 million Twitter users, have offered a deal to Twitter. Israeli cyber intelligence firm, Hudson Rock, has revealed that the data of Twitter users stolen by the hacker contains devastating amounts of information, including e-mails and phone numbers of high-profile users including Salman Khan, Charlie Puth, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The firm has also shared pictures of the post on Twitter in which the hacker has shared information about the data leak.\n\n\u201cI am selling data of +400 million unique Twitter users that was scrapped via a vulnerability, this data is completely private,\u201d the hacker wrote in his post adding, \u201cTwitter or Elon Musk, if you are reading this post, you are already at risk of GDPR fines for the data leak of over 54 million users.

      "text": "On the afternoon of December 8 local time, President Xi Jinping met with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia at Riyadh\u2019s al-Yamamah Palace.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping said that he was glad to visit Saudi Arabia again after six years and could still recall vividly his last visit. President Xi Jinping expressed his pleasure to see the important consensus they reached back then on developing China-Saudi Arabia relations being translated into concrete cooperation. China-Saudi Arabia cooperation enjoys broad prospects. China sees Saudi Arabia as an important force in the multi-polar world and attaches great importance to developing the comprehensive strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia. China stands ready to further strengthen strategic communication and deepen cooperation across the board with Saudi Arabia to deliver for the development interests of the two countries and safeguard world peace and stability.\n\nKing Salman extended his warm welcome to President Xi Jinping for visiting Saudi Arabia again and said that President Xi Jinping\u2019s successful visit to Saudi Arabia in 2016 was truly memorable. In recent years, China and Saudi Arabia made excellent progress in creating synergy between strategies and conducting bilateral cooperation in various fields. The two sides have reached important common understandings on many issues, and what are China\u2019s interests are Saudi Arabia\u2019s interests as well. King Salman noted that he highly values relations with China and is ready to work with President Xi Jinping to advance Saudi Arabia\u2019s comprehensive strategic partnership with China and deliver more benefits to both peoples sharing friendly relations. This is also conducive to regional and global peace, stability and tranquility.\n\nThe two heads of state co-signed in person the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and agreed to take turns to host biennial meetings between the heads of state of the two countries.",

Meanwhile, Penelope Cruz, who has been calling out ageism for years, tells journalists who ask her about her status as an ageing actor, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you even two minutes to honour your question. It doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d\n\nBack in 2015, Dame Helen Mirren, now a silver-haired 77-year-old, had best articulated the ageist bias with regard to women actors in Hollywood: \u201cWe all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger.

It doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d\n\nAll three are powerful women in Hollywood, speaking from a position of acquired strength and wisdom, trying to change the gendered discourse on their terms. Backed by a body of award-winning work that has brought big bucks and value to the big studios that hired them, they earned their podium rights.\n\nRaveena Tandon is nowhere near them but is no less qualified to talk about ageist biases in Bollywood. She asked why her peer Madhuri Dixit should be pigeonholed as a \u201cfemale superstar of the 90s\u201d when their male peers are considered ageless. She should know this best. Having begun her career with actor Salman Khan in Patthar Ke Phool (1991) and delivered the cult hit Andaz Apna Apna (1994) with him. They were the flower children of a just-liberalised India. Yet she wilted by the wayside while Khan at 57 continues to romance Pooja Hegde, 32, in 2022. And courtesy of the finesse of air-brushing technology and a few cosmetic makeovers, we never make out a difference. Salman at 57 in his Panvel farmhouse, hiding his frailties, will never be the digitally-mastered and larger-than-life Salman on screen. May we say, Tandon herself would look much better, with or without the cosmetic jugglery, if the two were cast together. But that would, as trade pundits would tell you, be harakiri for the producer in an industry that equates alpha maleness to financial muscle. Be it Aamir or Shah Rukh, the selling point of their ventures has been their investable worth as age-defying demigods. Consider the publicity propaganda of Aamir\u2019s Three Idiots (\u201cOh, he looks like a college kid\u201d) or even Shah Rukh\u2019s Pathaan (\u201cOh look at those abs at 57\u201d).\n\nThis is where the efforts of Vidya Balan or more recently, Alia Bhatt, who have shouldered the burden of being the protagonist and delivered Rs 100-crore revenues for their producers, come to nought. Unfortunately, their projects are still considered women-oriented and not mainstream films \u2014 a value-add than the value itself. A woke moment that allows Bollywood to pat itself on the back for being in sync with the times. In fact, the definition of mainstream films in India, be it Hindi or regional blockbusters, continues to be contoured by the idea of a Herculean male superstar. Even successful women filmmakers like Farah Khan sadly entrench the male stereotype to get the crowds going at Chandan cinema, her barometer for pan-India success. Zoya Akhtar, for all her attempts at slice-of-life realism on the big screen, is still considered effete. Fact is, the idea of a woman superstar has never been tested or allowed to flourish enough in the mass market, which has, by now, been heavily drugged on formula. In a country where Shakti peeths draw in the most pilgrims, that wouldn\u2019t be impossible really.\n\nTandon, many critics believe, made her dough by catering to the male gaze through song sequences like Tu Cheez Bari Hai Mast Mast, and, therefore has no locus standi to talk about the rightful place of women in the film industry. In her time, even the likes of Madhuri Dixit weren\u2019t really given the space to exercise their acting chops. Just map the cult Bollywood hit songs; chances are they would mostly feature more women than men. As for acting chops, Dixit and Karisma Kapoor did manage to get noticed in the latter half of their industry shelf life. Today, it is the so-called \u201c90s women superstars\u201d who have aced the OTT ratings, Tandon herself playing an investigative woman cop with Aranyak, Dixit as a justice-seeking ageing actress in The Fame Game and Sushmita Sen a revenge-seeking Aarya. Such has been their performance that studios themselves are offering them new seasons. Besides, they are all ambassadors for top-of-the-line brands, motivational speakers, show hosts and anchors, all of which are the ad world\u2019s barometer for public acceptance. They all play to their strengths, unabashed about their age and wrinkles, and in their sequences definitely look fitter than Aamir Khan running as Lal Singh Chadha. This, after taking their breaks for marriage and maternity and owning their evolution as women.\n\nOf course, the media itself, which is best placed to correct perceptions, is equally guilty. While branding the efforts of 40-plus women as a \u201ccomeback\u201d, it fetes Aamir Khan for taking a \u201cyear\u2019s creative break\u201d for \u201cfamily time\u201d and his suddenly undyed hair. Will it question him about a \u201ccomeback\u201d a year later or pardon him the vanity of colouring his hair? Or starring with a newbie and justify it as another \u201chatke\u201d film? Won\u2019t it be a too-90s thing to do?",
