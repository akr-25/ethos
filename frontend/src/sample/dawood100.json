Makers of the docu-drama unveiled the trailer on the release date while giving a glimpse of the battle for the future of Mumbai which raged through the 1990s. The gritty drama features a cat-and-mouse chase between the D-Company and the Encounter Squad.\n\nNetflix on January 6 released the trailer of the wild gangster drama, Mumbai Mafia: Police vs the Underworld. The documentary focuses on how police officers took it upon themselves to be the judge, jury, and executioner. The gripping video shows how gangsters were rampant in Mumbai and how cops wanted to change the entire scenario.\n\n\u2018Shoot first and ask questions later\u2019 were the kind of orders given to the cops and they were asked to go all wild on the field after the gangsters. At one point in the trailer, it states how the concept of \u201cencounters\u201d is introduced. It was constantly used in headlines and often accompanied by facts about how many gangsters were killed during the \u201cencounter\u201d. If you have watched some other Indian documentaries, then you will realise under what tough and hard conditions the police had to work throughout to chase the gangster.\n\nWith many Bollywood films touching upon the life of Dawood Ibrahim before, it will be interesting to see how Netflix attempts to unveil the background, crimes, and controversies surrounding the mafia. While sharing the trailer, Netflix on Instagram wrote, \u201cMumbai in the 90s was synonymous with organized crime and gangsters. Travel back to a time, when the battle between law & order and the underworld was at its peak in #MumbaiMafia, streaming now on Netflix (sic)\u201d\n\nDawood Ibrahim is a wanted terrorist from Mumbai whom the United Nations has designated as a global terrorist. Several cases have been lodged against him by different national agencies, including a money laundering case and an arms smuggling case.","title":"Mumbai Mafia begins streaming on Netflix, documentary explores life of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2JpbmdlLXdhdGNoL3N0b3J5L211bWJhaS1tYWZpYS1iZWdpbnMtc3RyZWFtaW5nLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtZG9jdW1lbnRhcnktZXhwbG9yZXMtbGlmZS1vZi11bmRlcndvcmxkLWRvbi1kYXdvb2QtaWJyYWhpbS0yMzE4Mjc1LTIwMjMtMDEtMDbSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvYmluZ2Utd2F0Y2gvc3RvcnkvbXVtYmFpLW1hZmlhLWJlZ2lucy1zdHJlYW1pbmctb24tbmV0ZmxpeC1kb2N1bWVudGFyeS1leHBsb3Jlcy1saWZlLW9mLXVuZGVyd29ybGQtZG9uLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLTIzMTgyNzUtMjAyMy0wMS0wNg?oc=5","videos":[{"height":"365","src":"https://embed.indiatoday.in/share/video/india/video/MTczNDY3NA==","width":"648"}]},{"author":["Tina Das"],"canonicalLink":"https://theprint.in/features/reel-take/watch-mumbai-mafia-if-d-company-encounters-and-the-terror-of-bombay-still-intrigue-you/1302966/","copyright":"2022 Printline Media Pvt","date":"2023-01-07T08:17:44.000Z","description":"Mumbai Mafia focuses on how a few cops became larger-than-life figures as they tackled the rising terror and Mumbai\u2019s organised crime through encounters.","image":"https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/d-company.jpg","lang":"en","links":[{"href":"https://theprint.in/features/reel-take/the-pale-blue-eye-is-a-gothic-mystery-thriller-brimming-with-potential-until-it-nosedives/1302883/","text":"&#x2018;The Pale Blue Eye&#x2019; is a gothic mystery thriller brimming with potential.

Directed by Francis Longhurst and Raaghav Dar, the documentary\u00a0gets a thriller-like treatment\u00a0as the saga of mafia and Mumbai Police\u2019s encounter specialists\u00a0plays\u00a0out.\n\nThe tension is created and held taut by\u00a0a shorter run time\u00a0that converts into\u00a0lack of any wasted frame or\u00a0cinematic\u00a0moment.\u00a0Mumbai Mafia\u00a0focuses on how a few cops became larger-than-life figures as they tackled the rising terror\u00a0and\u00a0Mumbai\u2019s organised crime through encounters. Two ex-Mumbai cops, Pradeep Sharma and Ravindranath Angre, talk extensively to the makers\u00a0of the documentary. Sharma is currently awaiting bail hearing\u00a0in a case related to\u00a0murder of businessman Mansukh Hiren. While Sharma has to his record more than 100 encounters, Amngre has allegedly killed 54 alleged gangsters in multiple encounters.\n\nThe documentary traces the rise and fall of the cops, including that of\u00a0Vijay Salaskar, another encounter specialist\u00a0who was killed in action during 26/11. And how their popularity inspired multiple Bollywood movies, and\u00a0a near cult\u00a0following among\u00a0local\u00a0people. But the tide turned soon after a TIME magazine report in 2003\u00a0that raised questions on\u00a0the\u00a0police\u2019s credibility and the\u00a0\u2018encounters\u2019\u00a0it had conducted. The documentary also keeps alluding to the myth and life of Dawood\u00a0Ibrahim\u00a0and the infamous\u00a0\u2018D-company\u2019\u00a0that once\u00a0had its hand in almost every single business in Mumbai, including financing Bollywood films.\n\nAlso read: \u2018The Pale Blue Eye\u2019 is a gothic mystery thriller brimming with potential. Until it nosedives\n\nWhat works for\u00a0Mumbai Mafia\u00a0is\u00a0the lure\u00a0and the lore\u00a0of Mumbai\u00a0gangsters\u00a0that still generates curiosity. A decade of terror in Mumbai is pieced together meticulously through the accounts of police officers, journalists and a former \u2018D-Company\u2019 member.\n\nWhile multiple movies \u2014 from Nana Patekar\u2019s\u00a0Ab Tak Chhappan\u00a0(2004), to\u00a0Shootout at Lokhandwala\u00a0(2007) and its sequel and\u00a0Once Upon A Time in Mumbai\u00a0(2010) \u2014 have been based loosely on the real-life characters and incidents, this documentary brings those faces together for the viewers. There is no masala or songs, just cops who believe that they cleaned up the city good.\n\nWhile Sharma and Angre speak with obvious pride about their role in eliminating gangsters, the voice of conscience among\u00a0the cops of that era\u00a0was police chief and founder of ATS, A. A Khan.\u00a0It was Khan who led the\u00a0shootout at Lokhandwala that resulted in the deaths of gangsters\u00a0Maya Dolas and Dilip Buwa\u00a0in 1991.\u00a0Khan, who spoke to the makers of the documentary before his death mentions\u00a0resigning from the force because he was disturbed by the blatant encounters and the competition among officers to have the bigger hit list.\n\nFormer\u00a0journalists and authors Hussain Zaidi and Puja Changoiwala weigh in with their inputs and experience of covering Mumbai and the cops, and how the tide turned\u00a0against the encounter specialists. Alex Perry, former\u00a0TIME\u00a0magazine correspondent, describes his experience of interviewing Sharma and the eventual impact of the piece on the culture of encounters.\n\nThe documentary does not glorify the encounter cops, but definitely gives\u00a0mind boggling\u00a0insight into the world the cops inhabited. The cops talk about struggling with their first encounters, and later treating it as a necessary evil. In a city crumbling under the weight of extortions, killings and fear,\u00a0\u2018heroes\u2019\u00a0had to rise, suggests the documentary.\n\nThe documentary doesn\u2019t shed much light on the man who ran the show of terror three decades ago\u2014Dawood Ibrahim. Barring a few\u00a0anecdotes through his former neighbour Feroz Sayed, and an ex-\u2018D Company\u2019 employee Shyam Kishore,\u00a0there is not much that one gets to know\u00a0about the man or his mind.\n\nFrom the first killing to the 1993 blasts, Ibrahim is\u00a0shown to be\u00a0ruthless but highly organised, and methodical. Abu Salem\u2019s capture by CBI and eventual extradition is the closest India gets to Ibrahim, who still remains at large. Updates about his \u2018supposed location\u2019 are a regular feature till date in India media.\n\nMumbai Mafia is making and unmaking of the encounter specialists by the media,\u00a0where\u00a0both Sharma and Aghre talk about being treated unfairly. But they also take it in their stride as the\u00a0peripeteia\u00a0imminent in a hero\u2019s life. For better or for worse, Mumbai was cleaned up, and the terror of the mafia did die out, and for most, including Sharma and Aghre, that trumps everything else.","title":"Watch Mumbai Mafia if \u2018D-Company\u2019, encounters and the \u2018terror\u2019 of Bombay still intrigue you","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3JlZWwtdGFrZS93YXRjaC1tdW1iYWktbWFmaWEtaWYtZC1jb21wYW55LWVuY291bnRlcnMtYW5kLXRoZS10ZXJyb3Itb2YtYm9tYmF5LXN0aWxsLWludHJpZ3VlLXlvdS8xMzAyOTY2L9IBigFodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3JlZWwtdGFrZS93YXRjaC1tdW1iYWktbWFmaWEtaWYtZC1jb21wYW55LWVuY291bnRlcnMtYW5kLXRoZS10ZXJyb3Itb2YtYm9tYmF5LXN0aWxsLWludHJpZ3VlLXlvdS8xMzAyOTY2Lz9hbXA?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":[],"canonicalLink":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/fpjexclusive-once-dreaded-don-now-needs-a-walking-stick","copyright":"The Free Press Journal","date":"2023-01-04T05:53:00.000Z","description":"Sources in the security agencies told FPJ that three months ago two of Dawood Ibrahim's toes were amputated to arrest the spread of gangrene.

Two of his toes have been amputated in a Karachi hospital following the onset of gangrene.\n\nTwo years ago, one of his former aides Ejaz Lakdawala, who was arrested by Mumbai police while trying to flee to Nepal, had told the police that\u00a0the gangster\u00a0was suffering from gangrene.\u00a0At that time Chhota Shakeel, a close aide of the\u00a0gangster, had vehemently denied the claim.\n\nHowever, sources in the security agencies told\u00a0Free Press Journal\u00a0on Tuesday that three months ago two of the dreaded\u00a0gangster\u2019s\u00a0toes were amputated to arrest the spread of gangrene.\u00a0The gangster was against the surgery but doctors\u00a0said unless that is done, the condition could become critical. The surgery was done in a Karachi hospital under the close supervision of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI).\n\nThis has made walking difficult for\u00a0the\u00a0don, who now\u00a0uses\u00a0a walking stick. Sources said his reflexes have slowed down and he is today a pale image of himself. However, mentally he continues to be alert as before.\n\nThe don\u2019s\u00a0birthday was on December 26, but unlike in the past, the celebrations\u00a0this year\u00a0were extremely low-key,\u00a0according to\u00a0sources. Only a few close friends based in Pakistan were allowed to personally greet him.\n\nWho's who of Pakistan used to attend  Dawood's birthday bash\n\nEarlier, the Who's Who of Pakistan's elite, including senior army officers, used to attend his elaborate birthday bashes, which also had Bollywood celebrities in attendance.\u00a0It was an event eagerly awaited by\u00a0the\u00a0A listers of Karachi, Lahore, and other cities in Pakistan. The celebrations were mostly held in his palatial house in Defence Colony,\u00a0in\u00a0the posh Clifton area of Karachi.\n\nGangster delegated powers to his aide Chhota Shakeel and brother Anees\n\nA few years ago, when this correspondent went to Clifton he was stopped by a posse of armed guards outside the bungalow.\u00a0Security at the house was heightened after\u00a0the gangster\u2019s\u00a0arch rival, Chhota Rajan, who is lodged in Delhi's Tihar jail, had planned to assassinate him while he is being driven from his Clifton house to safe houses set up by the ISI in other parts of the port city. However,\u00a0the\u00a0dreaded\u00a0gangster\u00a0had\u00a0got wind of the plot.\n\nAnees Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel in charge of operations\n\nThe don\u00a0has delegated much of his powers to his brother Anees Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel,\u00a0according to reports. A few years ago when there were differences between\u00a0the two, the dreaded criminal\u00a0intervened and sorted out the problem\u00a0that\u00a0was threatening to split the gang.\n\nNow his gang is better managed under the supervision of the ISI. Shakeel is now in charge of operational matters, while Anees looks after his brother's vast business empire spread over the Indian subcontinent, Middle East and Europe.\n\nMajor presence in Mumbai with many of the realtors\n\nIn Mumbai, Dawood has a major presence with many of the builders undertaking redevelopment projects being ordered to give old building demolition contracts only\u00a0to\u00a0members\u00a0of his gang.\u00a0Recently, a demolition contractor with links to\u00a0his gang\u00a0was arrested by the Mumbai police.","title":"Once dreaded don Dawood Ibrahim now needs a walking stick","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwcmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuaW4vbXVtYmFpL2ZwamV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1vbmNlLWRyZWFkZWQtZG9uLW5vdy1uZWVkcy1hLXdhbGtpbmctc3RpY2vSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcHJlc3Nqb3VybmFsLmluL2FtcC9tdW1iYWkvZnBqZXhjbHVzaXZlLW9uY2UtZHJlYWRlZC1kb24tbm93LW5lZWRzLWEtd2Fsa2luZy1zdGljaw?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Romaa Daas"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.lifestyleasia.com/ind/culture/entertainment/mumbai-mafia-true-story-of-don-dawood-ibrahim/","copyright":"2023 Copyright LIFESTYLE ASIA","date":"2023-01-06T04:13:19.000Z","description":"Netflix's 'Mumbai Mafia' is a true crime documentary on real-life gangster Dawood Ibrahim who reigned terror in Mumbai in the 90s.","image":"https://images.lifestyleasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/01/06090547/Mumbai-Mafia-1.jpg","lang":"en","links":[{"href":"https://www.lifestyleasia.com/ind/culture/entertainment/popular-bollywood-movies-that-got-a-southern-remake/","text":"Bollywood"},{"href":"https://instagram.com/p/CnBjlhGhvPM/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading","text":"A post shared by Netflix India (@netflix_in)"},{"href":"https://www.lifestyleasia.com/ind/culture/entertainment/best-crime-documentaries-to-watch-on-amazon-prime-video/","text":"crime"}],"loadedUrl":"https://www.lifestyleasia.com/ind/culture/entertainment/mumbai-mafia-true-story-of-don-dawood-ibrahim/","publisher":"Lifestyle Asia India","softTitle":"'Mumbai Mafia' on Netflix explores the life of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim","tags":["Netflix","Gangster movies Bollywood","true crime dramas","Mumbai Mafia","Travel","Food","Entertainment"],"text":"Stories revolving around Mafia have always been a subject of interest. While the West had a cult classic like Godfather which was inspired by real-life mafia boss Frank Costello, India too had flicks like Company, D, Shootout at Lokhandwala, and Once Upon a Time in Mumbai which drew inspiration from India\u2019s most dreaded gangster Dawood Ibrahim. And now Netflix is bringing alive the story of this mafia who reigned terror in Mumbai in the 90s \u2013 Dawood Ibrahim.\n\nWhile Bollywood touched upon the life and times of Dawood Ibrahim rather ostentatiously, it will be interesting to see how Netflix attempts to unveil the background, crimes, and controversies surrounding the notorious mafioso. The true crime documentary, which is releasing on Netflix today, on January 6, will give an insight into the crime world of the Dawood Ibrahim.\n\nNetflix released a poster of the same a day earlier captioning it as this, \u201cFrom the underbelly to the high-rise cityscape of Mumbai, organised crime in the 90s truly exploded. Witness the Police and the mafia come face to face in this true crime documentary-Mumbai Mafia, streaming tomorrow, only on Netflix.\u201d\n\nHe has been designated as a global terrorist by India and the United States and carries a bounty of USD 25 million for his suspected role in the 1993 Mumbai blast. He is referred to as the underworld don of Mumbai. Though his whereabouts remain practically unknown, the feared gangster continues to intrigue people in India. So much so, that books and films have been made about his life.\n\nDawood\u2019s criminal journey dates back to his teenage years when started committing petty frauds and thefts. He later joined local gangster Basshu Dada and formally became a part of the organised crime syndicate. However, in the 1970s, he split from the gang and formed his own along with his brother. But his brother wasn\u2019t there for too long. He was killed by a rival Pathan gang and Dawood was left alone to keep in check the fate of his crime organisation. Thus, it led to the formation of D-Company. Through D-Company, Dawood started gold smuggling, extortion, and drug trafficking. Things were going well until he was wanted by the Mumbai Police for the murder of Samad Khan. He fled to Dubai only to expand his gang with the help of his second-in-command, Chhota Rajan. Soon after, he was named the mastermind of the 1993 Mumbai bombings by the Indian government and the rest as they say is history.\n\nNo one has seen Dawood Ibrahim ever since. Although news of his staying in Karachi and UAE often pops up, it isn\u2019t known as to where his real location is.\n\nNetflix is going all out in bringing true crime documentaries to the platform and Mumbai Mafia: Police vs The Underworld is surely one which everyone is excited about.","title":"'Mumbai Mafia' on Netflix explores the life of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2luZC9jdWx0dXJlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVtYmFpLW1hZmlhLXRydWUtc3Rvcnktb2YtZG9uLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2luZC9jdWx0dXJlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVtYmFpLW1hZmlhLXRydWUtc3Rvcnktb2YtZG9uLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltL2FtcC8?oc=5","videos":[{"height":"315","src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/08alafhCRKU","width":"560"}]},{"author":["Mumbai,"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/social-recognition-made-dawood-ibrahim-monster-says-former-cp-1172075.html","copyright":"2022 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd","date":"2022-12-15T14:09:10.000Z","description":"Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim became a monster because he was given social recognition, says former Mumbai Police chief M N Singh.\u00a0 \u201cDawood Ibrahim became a monster because he was given social recognition.

They can get votes. What can the police do in this situation? Politicians wake up only when it comes to their necks. Now I hear politicians getting involved with gangsters and are purchasing property from them.\u201d\n\nSingh besides being the Mumbai Police Commissioner, had in the past held several important assignments including that of Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), and had overseen the investigations of the 12 March, 1993 serial blasts.\n\nReferring to the infamous Antilia case in which two encounter specialist cops were arrested for planting explosives outside Mukesh Ambani\u2019s residence and killing a businessman, Singh said \u201cThere has not been a more shameful incident than this in the history of the Mumbai Police. The motto of the Mumbai Police is to protect the good and finish the bad, but in this case, the cops acted in contradiction. I can only apologise on behalf of the Mumbai police.

The 1,000-page chargesheet included statements of around 25 witnesses and other evidence against the accused persons. The agency claimed that Chhota Shakeel has been operating a separate gang since 1999.\n\nThe businessman had approached the Versova police in September last year, alleging that Fruit and Bhati had extorted a sum of \u20b97.5 lakh and also forcibly taken away his Range Rover worth around \u20b930 lakh. The case was registered with the Versova police and then transferred to the AEC.\n\nApart from Bhati, and Fruit, AEC has also named Ajay Gosaliya, Firoz Shaikh, Sameer Khan, Amjad Redkar, Javed Khan alias Papa Pathan as accused in the case. In its chargesheet, the AEC claimed the probe revealed that the seven are active members of Shakeel\u2019s gang.\n\nMumbai police has claimed that probe has revealed that Shakeel\u2019s own gang has been in operation since the year 1999 and that several new as well as old members are a part of it. It is further claimed that the seven booked in the case are old members of the Dawood gang and have worked together for many years.\n\nThe AEC has claimed that the seven are active members and have been threatening people to terrorise them and extract financial benefit for both themselves and the gang.\n\nIn the case, the businessman had good relations with Bhati and hence, was invited to his birthday celebration at a five-star hotel in Andheri. It was at this party that he was introduced to Fruit.\n\nIt was alleged that the complainant started playing cards with the accused and won around \u20b9 62 lakh in the game. However, on certain occasions, Fruit won the games and started demanding money. The complainant claimed that the accused started threatening him for money showing his connection with Shakeel.\n\nThe complainant has alleged that Fruit forcibly took his Range Rover car and further demanded \u20b9 32 lakhs.\n\nWhen Fruit came under the radar of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Fruit had asked the complainant to urgently deposit \u20b96 lakhs to \u20b911 lakhs in some other account. Owing to continuous demands and threats, the complainant had deposited \u20b97.5 to the account of a close associate of Fruit.\n\nIn the meantime, Fruit was being questioned by the ED and also by the NIA. Bhati is alleged to have threatened the complainant and told him not to mention about any transactions with Fruit to the agencies. Hence, the businessman finally lodged a case with police.","title":"Chhota Shakeel operating his separate gang","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvbXVtYmFpLW5ld3MvY2hob3RhLXNoYWtlZWwtb3BlcmF0aW5nLWhpcy1zZXBhcmF0ZS1nYW5nLXBvbGljZS0xMDE2NzMxMjA1MTMzOTAuaHRtbNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvbXVtYmFpLW5ld3MvY2hob3RhLXNoYWtlZWwtb3BlcmF0aW5nLWhpcy1zZXBhcmF0ZS1nYW5nLXBvbGljZS0xMDE2NzMxMjA1MTMzOTAtYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Jitendra Dixit"],"canonicalLink":"https://news.abplive.com/crime/mumbai-gangsters-quirky-names-mucchad-dawood-ibrahim-engineer-ashwin-naik-machmach-fahim-gangster-stories-1571015","copyright":"Copyright@2022.

The witness upon whom the CBI relied had told the investigators that he heard one hitman say \u2013 \u201cNana se dushmani lene ka nateeja dekh \u201c (Look at the result of taking up enmity with Nana). The prosecution wasn\u2019t able to establish that \u201cNana\u201d which the witness referred to was Chhota Rajan. Although a court arrives at a judgement based on the evidence produced before it, it is also a fact that in the underworld gangsters have names which differ from what they are referred to by the police and the media.\n\nDawood Ibrahim, Chhota Rajan, Arun Gawli, Abu Salem and Amar Naik are some names that terrorised Mumbai in the decade of the 90s till the dawn of this century. There was a time when these names appeared on TV and in newspapers daily. But gangs have their own names for their members. Often, names are given based on a gangster\u2019s appearance, his habits, or because of affection.\n\nDawood Ibrahim, the boss of D-Company, is known as \u201cMucchad\u201d because of his thick moustache. His confidante Chhota Shakeel\u2019s real name is Shakeel Ahmed Shaikh, but is called Chhota Shakeel because of his short height. Once there were two Shakeels in the D-Company. Interestingly, the other one was also Shakeel Ahmed Shaikh. Since he was over 6 feet tall, the gang called him Lambu Shakeel. With their height-based names, the gang members could distinguish between the two Shakeels during conversations. Lambu Shakeel was deported from Dubai in 2003, and died of a heart ailment in March 2019 in Mumbai. Chhota Shakeel is still absconding and is believed to be in Pakistan\u2019s Karachi.\n\nDawood\u2019s nemesis, Chhota Rajan\u2019s real name, is Rajan Nikalje. He was referred to as Chhota (Small) because there was another gangster named Bada (Big) Rajan in the Mumbai underworld, who was Rajan Nikalje\u2019s mentor. Although Rajan Nikalje is popularly known as Chhota Rajan, his gang members affectionately call him Nana (Maternal Grandfather). His wife Sujata Nikalje is known as Nani (Maternal Grandmother).\n\nSimilarly, underworld don Arun Gawli is referred to as Daddy by his gang members and his wife, Asha Gawli, is called Mummy. Arun Gawli\u2019s brother Kishore, who was killed by the Dawood gang in 1989, was known as \u201cPapa\u201d. Gawli is presently serving a term of life imprisonment for the murder of a municipal corporator.\n\nAnother notorious gangster named Amar Naik was known as \u201cRavan\u201d by his gang members because of his cruel ways of dealing with his enemies and those who refused to pay up after his extortion calls. Amar Naik was killed during an encounter with the police in August 1996. After Amar\u2019s death, his younger brother Ashwin Naik took over the reins of the gang. He was called \u201cEngineer\u201d since he had studied civil engineering.\n\nUnderworld don Abu Salem\u2019s real name is Abdul Qaiyum Ansari. Fahim Shaikh of D-company was known as Fahim Machmach because of his talkative nature. In August 2021, he died in Karachi after getting infected by Covid-19. In 2003, Sharad Shetty, a close aide of Dawood Ibrahim killed in Dubai, was known as \u201cBada Idli\u201d.","title":"Stories Behind Quirky Names Of Mumbai Gangsters","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL25ld3MuYWJwbGl2ZS5jb20vY3JpbWUvbXVtYmFpLWdhbmdzdGVycy1xdWlya3ktbmFtZXMtbXVjY2hhZC1kYXdvb2QtaWJyYWhpbS1lbmdpbmVlci1hc2h3aW4tbmFpay1tYWNobWFjaC1mYWhpbS1nYW5nc3Rlci1zdG9yaWVzLTE1NzEwMTXSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmFicGxpdmUuY29tL2NyaW1lL211bWJhaS1nYW5nc3RlcnMtcXVpcmt5LW5hbWVzLW11Y2NoYWQtZGF3b29kLWlicmFoaW0tZW5naW5lZXItYXNod2luLW5haWstbWFjaG1hY2gtZmFoaW0tZ2FuZ3N0ZXItc3Rvcmllcy0xNTcxMDE1L2FtcA?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":[],"canonicalLink":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/prashanth-narayanan-says-kathmandu-connection-2-will-show-the-human-and-personal-side-of-dawood-ibrahim","copyright":"The Free Press Journal","date":"2022-12-21T17:45:00.000Z","description":"Prashanth Narayanan is known for his acting chops.

He will soon be seen in Kathmandu Connection 2. It will premiere on Sony LIV on December 23. The Free Press Journal caught up with the actor for an exclusive chat.\n\nOpening up about the locations of the show, Prashanth reveals, \u201cThe idea is that we were shooting in Chattarpur farm house and the set up area. It was a posh area, my house and the area has to look like where my character Wajid lives.\u201d\n\nThe actor is the new addition to the show. When asked if he sees his character going forward, he explains, \u201cIf they are planning season three, then it will definitely go forward. In the first season there were many references to this character which is based on Dawood Ibrahim. This time, I am playing that role so they will make me do many things.\u201d\n\nElaborating about his role, he adds, \u201cWhen you mention Dawood Ibrahim you understand the power that man will have is out to destroy the country. Apart from that, in this particular series, they will show his personal space also. That will be very interesting to watch.\u201d\n\nWhen probed further about his role, he states, \u201cKathmandu Connection 2 will show him living in Dubai and there is a small little love angle that he has which is there. Things which show the human side and personal side of Dawood rather than him as a villain are never seen before. Siddharth Mishra has written the script. It\u2019s very unique for me as I am shooting with the same unit of Rangbaaz. In that I am playing an honest and diligent cop and immediately after that, I am shooting as Dawood Ibrahim. For me it was a challenge. It is a role completely 180 degrees different. It feels great as these are things which keep an actor on their toes.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if his character will create any controversy, he avers, \u201cSiddharth is an intelligent writer and understands the game of writing something like a web series. It's different from a regular TV series. Siddharth and Sachin Pathak (director) work together as a team. All his web series have different leagues of people who want to change their ways. It feels interesting.\u201d\n\nTalking about his journey so far, he concludes, \u201cI have done what you rarely see any actor may have done. I have done Malayalam and Tamil films as well. Just now, I am shooting for a Kannada film Ghost with Dr Shiva Rajkumar. It is directed by Srini. They are planning to release it in other languages as well and I will say my lines in Kannada also. I am just trying to create a benchmark. My first film in Malayalam was called Unnam. Then I did a film called 10 Kalpanakal with Meera Jasmine and Anoop Menon. In Tamil also I have done two movies.\u201d","title":"Prashanth Narayanan says, 'Kathmandu Connection 2 will show the human and personal side of Dawood Ibrahim'","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcHJlc3Nqb3VybmFsLmluL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcHJhc2hhbnRoLW5hcmF5YW5hbi1zYXlzLWthdGhtYW5kdS1jb25uZWN0aW9uLTItd2lsbC1zaG93LXRoZS1odW1hbi1hbmQtcGVyc29uYWwtc2lkZS1vZi1kYXdvb2QtaWJyYWhpbdIBAA?oc=5","videos":[{"height":"315","src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vv_icZoxaf0","width":"560"},{"height":"315","src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBiY_6yIjOs","width":"560"}]},{"author":["DH Web Desk, Dec 19 2022, 11:57 istupdated: Dec 19 2022, 12:04 ist"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/if-not-savarkar-whose-poster-should-be-put-up-dawood-ibrahim-pralhad-joshi-slams-congress-for-protest-1173066.html","copyright":"2022 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd","date":"2022-12-19T06:27:50.000Z","description":"Amid protests by the Karnataka Congress after a portrait of Veer Savarkar was hung in the state Assembly session in Belagavi, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi said, \"If not Savarkar, whose poster must be put, of Dawood Ibrahim?\". \"There must be ideological differences but Savarkar is a freedom fighter.

India had received significant inputs on hawala operators, which led to the crackdown on Dawood\u2019s\u00a0associates and hawala operators,\u201d claimed an official of the National Investigation Agency (NIA).\n\nAll calls and messages\u00a0are being\u00a0handled by trusted aide, Fahim Machmach, with no family members\u00a0being\u00a0directly involved in criminal activities.\n\n\u201cFahim Machmach\u2019s\u00a0death due to covid in\u00a0August led to a void in D Company\u2019s\u00a0communications with associates in India and\u00a0the\u00a0UAE. Dawood has strictly\u00a0forbidden\u00a0family members to not get directly involved. Even Anis Ibrahim had taken a backseat from counterfeiting and drug trafficking,\u201d\u00a0contended\u00a0a\u00a0veteran Mumbai Police Crime Branch officer,\u00a0who has been\u00a0tracking\u00a0the\u00a0Dawood gang for 27 years.\n\nAs such,\u00a0NIA officials were surprised to hear the alleged voice of Mustaqeem, settling business disputes in call intercepts with Chhota Shakeel's brother-in-law Mohammed Salim Mohammed Iqbal Qureshi alias Salim Fruit, who is on the radar of probe agencies in connection with alleged money laundering, narco-terrorism, and smuggling.\n\nMustaqeem and Humayum,\u00a0who is also Dawood's younger brother,\u00a0have no criminal record and travel regularly to\u00a0the\u00a0UAE, Saudi\u00a0Arabia,\u00a0and African nations for business.\n\nNIA hit paydirt in routine surveillance of Salim Fruit when call intercepts led them to conversation allegedly with builder Aslam Patni, who claimed to have met Mustaqeem in Mecca, Saudi Arabia,\u00a0for the\u00a0settlement of\u00a0a\u00a0business dispute. The probe into meetings in Saudi Arabia\u00a0involving the Dawood gang\u2019s Mumbai associates\u00a0led investigators\u00a0to\u00a0the view that\u00a0Mustaqeem\u00a0has\u00a0allegedly emerged\u00a0as the key member in the criminal syndicate.\n\nHowever, advocate Viquar Rajguru, representing Salim Fruit, said that \"Mustaqeem and Salim Fruit had strained relations after some business disputes leading to Salim\u2019s deportation\u00a0to India. The alleged calls are bogus and\u00a0a\u00a0figment of imagination by investigating agencies.\u201d Rajguru alleged that stringent provisions of\u00a0the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act\u00a0and\u00a0the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act\u00a0were foisted on Salim Fruit.\n\nNIA had in February registered a case related to \u201cterrorist and criminal activities\u201d of smuggling, narco-terrorism, money laundering, circulation of fake currency, raising terror funds, and working in active collaboration with international terrorist organisations including Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Al Qaeda, allegedly by gangster Dawood Ibrahim and his associates.\n\nA series of 20 raids were conducted in Mumbai and adjoining Thane district against alleged associates of Dawood Ibrahim in which NIA picked up Salim Fruit from his residence in Bhendi Bazar. The premier anti-terror investigation agency had conducted raids at a housing society in Mumbai's Nagpada area, Bhendi Bazar, Santacruz, Mahim, and Goregaon areas of Mumbai, Mumbra in Thane and other places against associates of Dawood Ibrahim including several hawala operators and drug peddlers for money laundering and terror funding.\n\nTheEnforcement Directorate had also questioned Qureshi as part of its probe in a money laundering case linked to Dawood Ibrahim.\n\nLast month, Salim Fruit and four others were arrested by the anti-extortion cell (AEC) of Mumbai Police for allegedly usurping ownership of a building on Umerkhadi Road near Dongri by forging property documents.\n\nAccording to AEC officials, the hawala and extortion business of D Company was managed allegedly by Salim Fruit in Mumbai with instruction on mobile phones over VoIP calls from Karachi and Dubai.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising that Mustaqeem is surfacing in criminal activities.

The witness claimed that Machinder had visited Arif\u2019s office for resolving issues related to his two projects \u2013 Grove Tower in Oshiwara near Oshiwara police station and another one in Abhudaya Nagar in Kalachowki in Central Mumbai. The witness claimed that Arif had asked him to look into the documents as there were court and bank issues involved in the project.\n\n\u201cMachinder came to Arif Bhaijaan as he wanted his help to get back allotment letters from the old purchasers of Oshiwara project and to vacate all tenants from the old building of Abyudaya Nagar in Kalachowki,\u201d the witness told investigators.\n\nBesides, the witness said, \u201cFor this work Machinder was supposed to give \u20b9100 crore to Chhota Shakeel and D Company. Machinder had given \u20b916 crore in cash to Chhota Shakeel and D Company through Arif Bhaijaan and Shabbir Abubakar Shaikh. He had also issued 20 signed cheques of \u20b95 crores each, total amounting \u20b9100 crore and allotment letter of those flats,\u201d the witness further said in his statement.\n\nThe witness further said that Machinder had received \u20b9100 crore from investors in advance and now that he had received required permissions, he wanted to repurchase the properties from the same investors.\n\n\u201cMachinder gave this work to Arif Bhaijan. According to the deal, Machinder would give \u20b93000/- per sq ft, that is \u20b930 crore to D Company as commission for putting the investors in fear of death and usurp the property in the name of D Company through Arif Bhaijan and Shabbir,\u201d the witness claimed.\n\nThe NIA also recorded statement of Machinder who denied having met Arif or Shabbir ever in his life. About the cheques given to Arif\u2019s man, Machinder claimed, \u201cduring my project at Oshiwara, I had an ongoing financial dispute with PNB and Piramal group. At that time, I was searching for investors for the said project and accordingly many persons from finance sectors and real estate agents used to approach me for sanctioning the loan. As I was trying to get finance, I issued many cheques to many people as security for arranging a financer. In respect of the above cheque, I do not exactly recollect, to whom I had given the cheques. I did not maintain records of whom I gave such type of a cheque.\u201d","title":"City builder stuck a \u20b9100-cr deal with Chhota Shakeel to get two projects cleared","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL211bWJhaS1uZXdzL2NpdHktYnVpbGRlci1zdHVjay1hLTEwMC1jci1kZWFsLXdpdGgtY2hob3RhLXNoYWtlZWwtdG8tZ2V0LXR3by1wcm9qZWN0cy1jbGVhcmVkLTEwMTY3MjQyNDUxNzMyOC5odG1s0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvbXVtYmFpLW5ld3MvY2l0eS1idWlsZGVyLXN0dWNrLWEtMTAwLWNyLWRlYWwtd2l0aC1jaGhvdGEtc2hha2VlbC10by1nZXQtdHdvLXByb2plY3RzLWNsZWFyZWQtMTAxNjcyNDI0NTE3MzI4LWFtcC5odG1s?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["About the AuthorEntertainment BureauEntertainment Bureau brings you all updates from the world of entertainment -- breaking news, Twitter trends, features, movie reviews, exclusive inter...Read More"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.news18.com/news/entertainment/ayushmann-khurranas-an-action-hero-had-a-character-named-dawood-ibrahim-heres-why-it-was-changed-6573037.html","copyright":"2020 Cable News Network LP","date":"2022-12-10T10:28:58.000Z","description":"Ayushmann Khurrana's An Action Hero features a character of a gangster named Masood Abraham Katkar that was initially named Dawood Ibrahim.","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2022/12/befunky_2022-11-4_17-56-0-167050254416x9.jpg","keywords":"Ayushmann Khurrana, An Action Hero, Dawood Ibrahim, Bollywood","lang":"en","links":[{"href":"https://www.news18.com/movies/","text":"Bollywood"},{"href":"https://www.news18.com/entertainment/","text":"Latest Showsha News"}],"loadedUrl":"https://www.news18.com/news/entertainment/ayushmann-khurranas-an-action-hero-had-a-character-named-dawood-ibrahim-heres-why-it-was-changed-6573037.html","publisher":"News18","softTitle":"Ayushmann Khurrana's An Action Hero Had a Character Named Dawood Ibrahim, Here's Why It Was Changed","tags":[],"text":"Ayushmann Khurrana\u2019s An Action Hero might have opened to a lukewarm response at the Box Office but it has won the hearts of the critics and the audiences for its innovative and unique storyline pieced together with an unexpected climax. The film\u2019s plot has a connection with the dreaded gangster Dawood Ibrahim and the makers had to tweak some things to avoid any trouble.\n\nIn a scene, Ayushmann\u2019s character comes face to face with an insidious gangster. As per the sources close to Bollywood Hungama, initially he was supposed to be named Dawood Ibrahim but was changed to a different name in order to evade any controversy. The source explained, \u201cThe character of Maanav, played by Ayushmann Khurrana comes across a fugitive gangster in the second half. Initially, the makers had decided to name him Dawood Ibrahim. In fact, the character was based on the real-life underworld don.\"\n\nThe source continued, \u201cThe first cut of An Action Hero had the mention of Dawood Ibrahim. Later, however, the makers were advised not to use his name as it can lead to problems. As a result, Dawood Ibrahim was changed to Masood Abraham Katkar. The makers felt that the impact will still be made despite the name change. And looking at the response to the climax, the makers and the team of the film are surely relieved.\"\n\nHowever, even with the change of names, the character was still cognizable to the audience as he shared resemblance with Dawood. The source shared, \u201cThough the name was changed to Masood Abraham Katkar, the viewers were able to guess that he is based on Dawood Ibrahim. The gangster character even mentions that an old moustached picture of him wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette has been shown by the media for years. It was a clear giveaway.\"\n\nTouted to be Ayushmann Khurrana\u2019s first full-fledged action film, the actor plays Manav, an action hero on the run from Bhoora Solanki, who wants to avenge the mysterious death of his brother. Apart from Ayushmann, Anirudh Iyer\u2019s directorial also features Jaideep Ahlawat in a prominent role.\n\nRead all the Latest Showsha News here","title":"Ayushmann Khurrana's An Action Hero Had a Character Named Dawood Ibrahim, Here's Why It Was Changed","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL25ld3MvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9heXVzaG1hbm4ta2h1cnJhbmFzLWFuLWFjdGlvbi1oZXJvLWhhZC1hLWNoYXJhY3Rlci1uYW1lZC1kYXdvb2QtaWJyYWhpbS1oZXJlcy13aHktaXQtd2FzLWNoYW5nZWQtNjU3MzAzNy5odG1s0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9heXVzaG1hbm4ta2h1cnJhbmFzLWFuLWFjdGlvbi1oZXJvLWhhZC1hLWNoYXJhY3Rlci1uYW1lZC1kYXdvb2QtaWJyYWhpbS1oZXJlcy13aHktaXQtd2FzLWNoYW5nZWQtNjU3MzAzNy5odG1s?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["New Delhi,"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-bans-lets-proxy-outfit-the-resistance-front-1178338.html","copyright":"2023 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd","date":"2023-01-05T19:32:05.000Z","description":"The Government on Thursday night declared 'The Resistance Front' (TRF), a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), as a banned organisation and LeT's launching commander based in Pakistan Mohammed Amin as a terrorist under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.","favicon":"https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/png-32X32.png","image":"https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/articleimages/2023/01/06/terror-istock-1178158-1672915643-1178338-1673000493.jpg","keywords":"India News, India-Pakistan relations, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Pakistan","lang":null,"links":[{"href":"https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/us-pakistan-have-shared-interest-to-ensure-taliban-acts-against-terrorist-groups-says-state-depts-ned-price-1178158.html","text":"US, Pakistan have shared interest to ensure Taliban acts against terrorist groups, says State Dept&apos;s Ned Price"}],"loadedUrl":"https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-bans-lets-proxy-outfit-the-resistance-front-1178338.html","publisher":"Deccan Herald","softTitle":"Centre bans LeT's proxy outfit 'The Resistance Front'","tags":["Pakistan","India News","India-Pakistan relations","Lashkar-e-Taiba","DH Showtime"],"text":"The Government on Thursday night declared 'The Resistance Front' (TRF), a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), as a banned organisation and LeT's launching commander based in Pakistan Mohammed Amin as a terrorist under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.\n\nIn a notification, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the TRF was recruiting youth through online medium for furtherance of terrorist activities besides being involved in carrying out propaganda on terror activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIt also said the TRF is involved in psychological operations on social media platforms for inciting people of Jammu and Kashmir to join terrorist outfits.

He was alluding to comments of External Affairs Minister of India Jai Shankar. After chairing a special meeting of the UN Security Council focused on `global counter terrorism approach` Jai Shankar had told media that the world perceives Pakistan as epicentre of terrorism as it still shelters terrorist groups. Pakistan has been doing more than this. Apart from maltreatment of its minorities, It glorifies Osama bin Laden as a martyr and shelters terrorists like Lakhvi,Hafiz Saeed,Masood Azhar,Sajid Mir and Dawood Ibrahim and 126 UN designated terrorists and 27 UN designated terrorist groups.\n\nEver since it came into existence as a new country in August,1947, Pakistan has maintained hostile attitude towards its immediate biggest neighbour India. This is despite the fact that the author of two nation theory and founder of new nation of Pakistan Mohammed Ali Jinnah had advised the leaders of Pakistan to maintain good neighbourly relations with India but it has been hardly ever so from the very beginning. Despite being culturally also equally close to India,Pakistan linked its hostility towards India to the fault line of the world based on religion.\n\nJust to mention a few lows in its relations with and actions towards India,the first low occurred in 1947 when the princely ruler of Jammu and Kashmir Maharaja Hari Singh offered stand still agreement with both India and Pakistan to allow him time to decide about accession. While India called for talks, Pakistan accepted it in breach and finally sent in armed tribals on twenty second October,1947 to force accession on the princely ruler. The Maharaja had no choice but to accede to India. At the same time, though born itself out of two nation theory,Pakistan made all out efforts to effect political partition of princely states of India.\n\nAfter second world war the world had got divided into two blocks western block and Soviet block. Western block comprised mostly Europe and USA while Soviet block comprised mostly Russia and some countries in Asia and Europe known as USSR. India adopted non-aligned policy but true to its hostility towards India,Pakistan joined the western block. It entered into arms treaty with USA and received arms and ammunition from USA despite protests by India. It also joined pacts created to encircle Soviet Communist block.Pakistan did all this in the name of fighting against communism but the actual motive was hostility towards India. In 1959 the then Pakistan President General Ayub Khan declared that arms received from USA are not meant to be wrapped in wool clearly indicating that these can be used against India. This was so even when America had clearly told it that these should be used only for the specified purpose of fight against communism. Later during 1965 Indo-Pakistan war, Pakistan actually used these weapons against India.\n\nThe worst low level of Pakistan`s conduct and bankruptcy of its policy was witnessed when after General elections in Pakistan in 1970,East Pakistan as Bangladesh was known then got majority but its leader Sheikh Mujibur Rehman was denied the opportunity to form government in Pakistan because of supremacy of west Pakistan now known as Pakistan. To suppress the people of East Pakistan a reign of terror and genocidal crackdown was unleashed against ethnic Bengalis and Hindus there under orders of the then Pakistan military ruler General Yahaya Khan. The result was not victory for Pakistan but formation of Bangladesh and surrender of its ninty three thousand strong army before Indian army.\n\nAfter break-up of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became elected Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1973. Pakistan has been ruled by army every now and then and true to this rule Zulfikar Ali Bhutto too faced the same fate when the then Army Chief of Pakistan General Zia ul Haq seized power on 5.7.77. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was subsequently hanged in 1979. Apart from encouraging hard core Islam,Zia-ul-Haq turned Pakistan into conduit for American arms and ammunition for Mujahideen fighting against occupation of Afghanistan by erstwhile Soviet forces in 1979. Some of these arms were diverted to perpetrate cross-border terrorism in Kashmir. Erstwhile Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1991.In its hostility against India,Pakistan wanted to turn Afghanistan into its backyard and encouraged creation and rise of Taliban in Pakistan. During this period mostly out of spite for India,Pakistan also acquired clandestinely know how for making atom bomb. Yet another low by Pakistan was demonstrated in 1989 when despite assurances of good neighbourly relations by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan,ground had been already prepared for cross border terrorism in Kashmir. In yet another low, in 1999 Pakistan army had occupied Kargil heights vacated by Indian army before onset of severe cold there which led to war and vacation of occupied area by Pakistan.\n\nApart from other repercussions, all these low negative actions of Pakistan also turned it into a bastion for international terrorism. After attack on World Trade Centre and Pentagon on 11.9.2001, Pakistan too joined the USA and NATO led war to hunt down Osama bin Laden responsible for the attack and eliminate ruling Taliban in Afghanistan. Public opinion in Pakistan was strongly opposed to west and when the then Army ruler of Pakistan General Parvez Musharaf was questioned for joining the war, his reply was that had he not done so America might have taken action against Pakistan too. Subsequently Osama bin Laden was pinned down in Pakistan itself and shot dead.\n\nAll these low actions have also had a cumulative effect too and have brought Pakistan virtually on the brink of moral, intellectual and financial bankruptcy.Pakistan needs to introspect and change its course and attitude towards its biggest neighbour India. Holy Quran clearly ordains that one should have best relations with neighbours. This writer has held opinion and expressed it in his commentaries and other writings for the last three decades that Pakistan has to change and give up its support to cross-border terrorism to prepare ground for mutual dialogue. In the present day globalised world beset with problems of climate change,stockpiles of nuclear weapons,terrorism and so many other similar pressing problems coupled with requirements of continued and sustainable development,dialogue and diplomacy are the only way to settle mutual differences and problems. This alone can ensure security and even survival of mankind. It can also help evolution of human civilisation and establishment of global Parliament. Pakistan has also to realise that hard core idealogies particularly based on religion are getting loosened and hostility has to yield ground to love and mutual respect. All religions and philosophies ultimately lead to the same goal.\n\n(The author is former IIS Officer and freelance journalist)","title":"Pakistan's perennial hostility towards India - Jammu Kashmir Latest News","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZXhjZWxzaW9yLmNvbS9wYWtpc3RhbnMtcGVyZW5uaWFsLWhvc3RpbGl0eS10b3dhcmRzLWluZGlhL9IBAA?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":[],"canonicalLink":"https://www.wionews.com/india-news/new-low-even-for-pakistan-india-strongly-condemns-billawal-bhuttos-comment-543737","copyright":"2022","date":"2022-12-16T16:45:00.000Z","description":"The Indian ministry of external affairs has condemned Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto for his latest comments, calling it a \u201cnew low even for Pakistan\u201d.

Apart from this, he has held several important positions, such as the additional commissioner of police (crime branch) post, and headed the Maharashtra State Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS). Bharti has been involved in the investigation into several major crimes reported in the city including the 26/11 terror attacks.\n\nBharti is known to enjoy the confidence of Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is believed to have pushed for his appointment to the current post. Between 2014-2019, the officer enjoyed prominent postings. However, in October 2020, he was transferred by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to the Maharashtra State Security Corporation (MSSC), considered a not-so-prominent role.\n\nIt was again during the MVA regime that an FIR was registered against him along with two others on charges of not registering an FIR against BJP leader Hyder Azam\u2019s wife when it was alleged that fake documents were used to procure her passport. The police probe, however, did not find any evidence to back the charges and he was not named in the chargesheet filed by the Mumbai crime branch in connection with the case.\n\nThe Shinde-Fadnavis government in November 2022 rejected an inquiry report filed by former state DGP Sanjay Pandey against Bharti in connection with allegations made by convicted criminal Vijay Palande that Bharti had connections with criminals linked to Dawood Ibrahim. Pandey had been asked to conduct an inquiry into the matter by the previous MVA government, following which he submitted two reports.\n\nWhile some forces across the country like the Delhi Police have had special commissioners, the Mumbai police got the post for the first time. As per the order issued by the government, the special commissioner will be able to assist the Mumbai police commissioner.\n\nThe order states that five joint commissioners report to the commissioner and now the special commissioner will help out the commissioner.

Jaishankar reminded the world about ever present terror factory in Pakistan at the UNSC, Islamabad blamed India for attack on global terror king pin Hafiz Saeed, head of proscribed Lahore based Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), in 2021.\n\nSaeed\u2019s jihadist outfit along with Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) joined hands on November 26, 2008, to conduct massacre in Mumbai in which along with innocent Indians, US and Israeli nationals were also gunned down. While Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto railed against India on usual Kashmir issue, his junior minister ranted against the Modi government from Islamabad and blamed Delhi for 2021 bomb blast near Johar Town home of the global Sunni jihadist.\n\nThe December 13, 2001, attack on Parliament along with Pathankot air base attack, Uri Brigade attack and Pulwama attack were conducted by Bahawalpur, Punjab based globally proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group headed by Masood Azhar, the chairman of the Alvi family run terror factory.\n\nWhile the intelligence world knows that Masood Azhar and Indian terror fugitive Dawood Ibrahim are under Pak security of the head of state level, Bilawal Bhutto wants the world to believe that the Deobandi jihadist is in Afghanistan and wants the Taliban to hand him over to Pakistan. Even as junior minister Hina Khar accused India for getting UN terror designation for some four Indians blocked using its clout in the 1267 Committee, fact is that Pakistan\u2019s iron brother China tried to block global terrorist designation for Masood Azhar four times before caving in, and has been openly batting for Islamabad in the Al Qaida sanctions committee. China using its veto power in 1267 Committee has blocked global terror kingpins like Saeed\u2019s brother-in-law Abdul Rehman Makki, who carries a million-dollar bounty on his head, 26/11 killer Sajid Mir and JeM\u2019s operational chief Rauf Azhar Alvi.\n\nThat Khar chose to highlight the so-called attack on super jihadist Hafiz Saeed in a press conference in Islamabad on Wednesday, reveals the fear and threat to terror king pins in Pakistan in future. The Uri surgical strikes and the Balakot attack by the Narendra Modi government has instilled uncertainty in the minds of Rawalpindi GHQ and its civilian proxy because of which Islamabad feels that these super jihadists are under threat of elimination. Such is the fear of Modi\u2019s India that Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar are no longer seen in public spewing venom against India from either Occupied Kashmir or hinterland Pakistan. Indian fugitive Dawood Ibrahim is under level seven protection of the Pak security in Karachi and Khalistani separatists in Lahore are afraid to even eat after the death of terrorist Harvinder Singh alias Rinda. The remnants of Indian Mujahideen, the demon child of ISI sponsored Karachi project, which killed nearly 500 innocents during the previous UPA regime, are nowhere to be seen or heard.\n\nWhile Khar called India a \u201crogue state\u201d on Wednesday, no one in the global community except iron brother China is buying this nomenclature as virtually every terror attack in the past two decades in the world has had organic links in Pakistan. However, Islamabad\u2019s problems have become more complicated since the Modi government assumed power in 2014 and after the Taliban took over reins in Kabul on August 15, 2021. Just as Pakistan fears instant retaliation from India on account of any jihadi terror attack, it is now fearing the worst on its western border as the Taliban regime is totally at odds with Shahbaz regime. Extremists groups Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan as well as Baloch insurgents groups are up in arms against Rawalpindi. The Pakistan card in Kashmir no longer is working as the Jammu and Kashmir police with security forces has managed to take out Pak based terror group leaders and their local proxies in the Valley. Today, there are only terror modules of three to four jihadis with limited shelf life are operating in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, whose sole target are the Kashmiri Pandits and other minority communities of Kashmir. Even the Pakistan friendly ecosystem in Kashmiri media and beyond has turned against their handlers as a result of which journalists are being threatened by ISI proxies.\n\nWith the Modi government refusing to have any truck with either the military or the civilian establishment in Pakistan till terror is removed from the bilateral equation, Islamabad has no options but to rave and rant. No one is listening.","title":"Pak plays terror victim card on \u2018attack' on terrorist Hafiz Saeed","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS93b3JsZC1uZXdzL3Bhay1wbGF5cy10ZXJyb3ItdmljdGltLWNhcmQtb24tYXR0YWNrLW9uLXRlcnJvcmlzdC1oYWZpei1zYWVlZC0xMDE2NzEwODEyODA3MjAuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vd29ybGQtbmV3cy9wYWstcGxheXMtdGVycm9yLXZpY3RpbS1jYXJkLW9uLWF0dGFjay1vbi10ZXJyb3Jpc3QtaGFmaXotc2FlZWQtMTAxNjcxMDgxMjgwNzIwLWFtcC5odG1s?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":[],"canonicalLink":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/mumbai-suspect-containers-cleared-mysteriously-at-mumbai-docks","copyright":"The Free Press Journal","date":"2023-01-02T05:43:00.000Z","description":"The NCTC\u2019s analytics and risk management cell had notified Customs at the docks to put as many as 85 suspect containers on hold in December.","favicon":"https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2019-06/e1397379-7b9d-4ccb-9b54-b7538efd7f5f/256x256.png","image":"https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2020-02/ccadc83a-c63e-4276-b058-84dcaca33782/dock_441989_1920.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C3900%2C2048&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true","keywords":"containers,Mumbai,Mumbai docks ,NCTC","lang":"en","links":[],"loadedUrl":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/mumbai-suspect-containers-cleared-mysteriously-at-mumbai-docks","publisher":"Free Press Journal","softTitle":"Mumbai: Suspect containers cleared mysteriously at Mumbai docks","tags":[],"text":"Mumbai: Customs officers and intelligence agencies are stupefied by the mysterious clearing of containers, in violation of rules, from the Mumbai docks despite a hold being placed by the National Customs Targeting Centre (NCTC).\n\nThe NCTC\u2019s analytics and risk management cell had notified Customs at the docks to put as many as 85 suspect containers on hold in December, but many of them were cleared and allowed to leave without a thorough examination.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking that the Customs Superintendent and intelligence unit let the containers flagged by the NCTC leave the docks without a full physical examination for contraband,\u201d fumed a senior NCTC official.\n\nContainers on which the NCTC places a hold have to be examined by dock and intelligence officials and a report has to be submitted to the Customs Commissioner before they can be cleared.\n\nNCTC Mumbai provides intelligence alerts to Customs officers at airports and docks based on artificial intelligence and profiling of import and export documentation.\n\n\u201cFlimsy excuses are being offered that the consignments were cleared and went out of the dock gates before the hold intimation was received,\u201d the NCTC official said.\n\nIn the normal course, the official pointed out, it takes weeks for a container to be cleared and leave the docks, \u201cbut the suspect consignments were cleared on priority\u201d.\n\nThe Bombay docks were the stomping grounds of gangsters Karim Lala and Haji Mastan in the 1960s and 1970s, before the area was taken over by Dawood Ibrahim to smuggle gold and electronics.\n\n\u201cA criminal syndicate flourishes to clear smuggled contraband with forged documents, mis declaring cargo and bills of entry,\u201d said Customs House clearing agent Nimesh Mehta.\n\nThe Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has intercepted and seized narcotics and gold at the docks on several occasions.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) recently announced an award of Rs 25 lakh for any information leading to his arrest. However, Dawood continues to live safely in Pakistan, although the Pakistani establishment vociferously denied it for years.\n\nWhen Dawood Ibrahim settled in Pakistan in the aftermath of the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, it was a quid pro quo arrangement between him and Pakistan\u2019s Inter Service Intelligence (ISI). Dawood got a safe haven in Pakistan and protection from his rivals and Indian law enforcement agencies. In return, he was expected to execute ISI\u2019s evil designs in India using the manpower and network of his gang. The arrangement went well until 9/11 happened in New York City, following which a global war against terror was launched by the USA.\n\nSince Dawood had been a designated terrorist, Pakistan couldn\u2019t publicly accept that he was on its soil. India repeatedly highlighted on the international forum that Pakistan was harbouring the perpetrators of the 1993 massacre in Mumbai. This compelled Dawood to lie low and wind up his activities. In Mumbai, the police launched a violent campaign against his gang. Many of his shooters were killed or arrested under stringent laws. His brother Iqbal was deported to Mumbai in 2003 and incarcerated. Over two decades since the dawn of the new century, D-Company, as his gang is known in underworld parlance, became dormant.\n\nSecurity analysts and experts of the Mumbai underworld wonder why the ISI would continue to protect Dawood if he had become a spent force for them. It seems Dawood too was aware that he was safe in Pakistan only till the time he was useful to the ISI. Hence, he devised a strategy that would sustain him in Pakistan with the same privileges and protection. The strategy was to establish marital relationships with the high and mighty families of Pakistan. From being a pawn of the ISI\u2019s diabolical designs, he became their relative, their own man by marrying off his children, nieces and nephews to powerful personalities of Pakistan belonging to the fields of cricket, army and intelligence.\n\nIn July 2005, Dawood\u2019s daughter Mahrukh Kaskar married cricketer Javed Miandad\u2019s son Junaid. The highly guarded receptions were arranged in Karachi and Dubai. On June 26, 2008, Razzak, son of Dawood\u2019s deceased elder brother Sabir, got married to Nasreen, daughter of a senior agent of the ISI. After the death of Sabir during a gang war with the Pathan gang in Mumbai in February 1980, Dawood looked after the upbringing of Razzak and it was he who arranged his marriage to Nasreen. Dawood stayed with his four brothers, namely Anees, Mushtaqim, Humayun and Noor, in Pakistan and the children of these brothers have been also married into the powerful families of the Pakistani establishment. Noora died of kidney failure in 2009, whereas Humayun succumbed to cancer in June 2016.\n\nAs per sources, Dawood is running legitimate businesses in real estate and hospitality industries in Karachi, Dubai and London from his ill-gotten money and no longer requires indulging in smuggling and extortion for income. Tiger Memon, the prime accused of the 1993 blasts, is also said to be operating a cold storage facility on the outskirts of Karachi. However, close and distant relatives of Dawood and his prominent gang member Chhota Shakeel capitalise on their names back in Mumbai and have been accused of several charges ranging from extortion, threats and money laundering.","title":"Why A 'Spent Force' Dawood Ibrahim Still Gets Cover From Pakistan\u2019s

businessman Jabir Motiwala has won a case against the UK Home Office after it was found that his visa was unlawfully cancelled.\n\nMotiwala was unable to leave the UK\n\nKarachi-based businessman Jabir Motiwala has won a visa case against Home Office in the UK High Court.\n\nJabir Siddiq, known as Jabir Motiwala, had brought a case against the UK Home Office before the High Court about his visit visa cancellation.\n\nIt was concluded that former Home Secretary Priti Patel acted unlawfully when she cancelled Motiwala\u2019s visit visa and detained him.\n\nMotiwala\u2019s claim included his detention in the UK and the legal costs he had to pay for over two years.\n\nThis occurred due to the collapse of his American extradition case at the London High Court.\n\nMotiwala took such precautions to fight the US government\u2019s attempts to extradite him.\n\nThe US wanted to extradite Motiwala from London to Washington to face charges of drug importation, money laundering and alleged links to gangster Dawood Ibrahim. which could have ended in lifetime imprisonment.\n\nHowever, Motiwala argued that his visa \u2013 which permitted a 10-year stay \u2013 was unlawfully cancelled as it had no legal basis.\n\nThe Home Office stated that the businessman had overstayed beyond the six months allowed for international visitors.\n\nThis was because he was under arrest from August 18, 2018, till April 14, 2021.\n\nMotiwala was unable to leave the UK or meet the Home Office conditions as his Pakistani passport was in possession of UK officials.\n\nIn his application for a judicial review hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, Judge Justice Ellenbogen formed a preliminary view that the Home Office had acted unlawfully.\n\nThe judge said that by cancelling the UK visit visa of Motiwala, Priti Patel did not apply the correct rules.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Home Office agreed to restore Motiwala\u2019s visa, and award damages for being held unlawfully detained for seven days.\n\nThe Home Office also confirmed that they will return the legal fees in five figures that Motiwala had to pay for this judicial review.\n\nIn a statement, solicitors Sheryar Khan and Kinza Rana said:\n\n\u201cMr Jabir Siddiq has now been reissued his 10-year multiple-entry visit visa which is an incredible success and the Home Secretary has rectified their error in initially cancelling his visa.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the agreement with the Home Office for the compensation for Mr Motiwala who suffered great injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, adopted the legal route to establish on numerous occasions that he was wronged and unfairly treated.\n\n\u201cHe has been vindicated on all counts and justice has prevailed.\u201d","title":"Pakistani Businessman Wins UK Visa

New Indian Express","softTitle":"The Big Picture: Bollywood in 2022","tags":["bollywood"],"text":"As 2022 draws to a close the Hindi film industry has suffered yet another colossal setback. Bollywood\u2019s most prolific and consistently successful director, Rohit Shetty, has delivered a dead-on-arrival Cirkus. Expectations had been riding high on the major release despite its tepid advance booking as against the uncontainable wave of success of James Cameron\u2019s Avatar: The Way of Water. Afterall Cirkus had the magical sensibility of Shetty behind it, the one who is supposed to know the pulse of the Indian mass audience like no other. However, the loud, inane and annoying adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s The Comedy of Errors (rather Gulzar\u2019s Angoor) grossed paltry sums of Rs 6.25 crore and Rs 6.40 crore (according to film trade site, Bollywood Hungama) in the first two days of the festive weekend when the footfalls in theatres and ticket sales are supposed to surge. Unless some MBappe like turnaround happens in this game, it\u2019s looking like a certain loss than a possible win for Cirkus, ringing in gloom and despair than hope and cheer for an already beleaguered Bollywood as it enters 2023.\n\nBack in September, just before the release of Ayan Mukerji\u2019s big ticket fantasy Brahmastra: Part One\u2014Shiva, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap told me how much he wanted it to strike the elusive gold at box office. \u201cI prayed for its success even in my dreams,\u201d he said, even though his own brand of realistic, gritty, mid-budget cinema is far removed from the eye-popping stunts, song and dance, and spectacle of Brahmastra. \u201cOne successful tentpole film brings confidence and sets the money in circulation within the industry for all kinds of movies to get made, including my own. A filmmaker like me won\u2019t be able to exist if big films don\u2019t work,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the most expensive and ambitious Indian films, that tried to marry Indian mythology with Marvel\u2019s metaverse, Brahmastra did bring in a much-needed relief to Bollywood, raking in enough (Rs 306 crore gross as per Mumbai-based media consulting firm Ormax Media\u2019s October box office report) to be able to announce the second part of the trilogy.\n\nHowever, that was an exception than a rule in 2022 that had mostly been about much-touted films, riding on big stars and bigger budgets, failing to bring audiences to the theatres. As a result, there was a tight check on free-flowing cash and apprehensions about investment in newer productions. Upcoming projects got reviewed, revised, nipped in the bud, stalled, axed, budgets slashed, so much so that even release dates of films got shuffled around because of the fear and anxiety of rejection from the audience. In a nutshell, a lot of work slowed down through 2022. \u201cThere\u2019s been a state of panic and confusion in Bollywood,\u201d said film exhibitor and distributor Akshaye Rathi. Screenwriter Atika Chohan, underlining the uncertainty surrounding the films in the pipeline, said: \u201cThere is a sense of foreboding, of recession setting in. It\u2019s ominous, scary even for someone like me who has functioned on the fringes \u2026 Things have taken a melancholic turn in the last few months. We are clinging on to the projects, being watchful of the work.\u201d\n\nThis steep fall in Bollywood\u2019s fortunes came after a historic high in 2019 when the gross box office receipts in India (for films across all languages, including Hollywood) had broken Rs 10,000 crore mark, according to Ormax Media. Hindi films led this success march with a whopping 44% share of gross domestic box office, Hollywood (in all dubbed language versions) stood second with 15%, followed by Tamil and Telugu films, at 13% each. Footfalls in cinema halls also crossed an important threshold of 100 crore, reaching 103 crore in 2019, up from 2018\u2019s 94.5 crore. Hindi cinema contributed 33% to domestic footfalls with Tamil at 19%, Telugu 18% and Hollywood 9%.\n\nThis growth story for Bollywood has come undone in the wake of the changing dynamics during and after COVID making it is go through one of its worst phases in history.\n\nBarely five Hindi films, apart from Brahmastra of about 80-odd released in the theatres, fared well this year. It included The Kashmir Files, Drishyam 2, Gangubai Kathiawadi and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 with Jugjugg Jeeyo touted as a decent earner. The parade of flops, on the other hand, has been endless. \u201cThese have been the odd ones out amid below par performers. The lean patch has been continuing,\u201d said Shailesh Kapoor, founder and CEO, Ormax Media.\n\nCirkus caps Bollywood\u2019s festival-time disasters. Heropanti 2 came a cropper during Eid. Raksha Bandhan in August sent the industry in mourning with two major releases sinking without a trace\u2014Laal Singh Chaddha and Rakshabandhan. Ram Setu and Thank God ushered in a black Diwali. Between May and July, one of the biggest, old-time Bollywood studio Yash Raj Films, delivered three back-to-back duds\u2014Jayeshbhai Jordaar, Samrat Prithviraj and Shamshera. As compared to Vikas Bahl\u2019s Goodbye, starring Amitabh Bachchan, there was much more excitement for \u201cBack To The Beginning,\u201d a four-day festival of 11 of Bachchan\u2019s most iconic films across 17 cities, to mark his 80th birthday in October.\n\nMovie watching culture in India has been driven by the top stars, that too male, with their loyal fans queuing up in a show of strength on the \u2018first day, first show\u2019 of their idol\u2019s new venture. So, in the pre-pandemic reality, a bulk of films\u2019 business would happen on the first weekend of the release. The \u2018opening,\u2019 as it is called in the trade parlance in Bollywood, would make or break a film. However, now despite aggressive promotions and presence of the most beloved stars, the theatres are running empty on the first few days of the release. \u201cOpenings of most big stars have dropped to 40-60% of their pre-pandemic openings, indicating that star power is diminishing,\u201d said Kapoor.\u00a0Akshay Kumar got the distinction of delivering five duds in a row this year\u2014Bachchhan Paandey, Rakshabandhan, Samrat Prithviraj, Cuttputlli and Ram Setu. Cirkus marks the third consecutive flop for Ranveer Singh after 83 and Jayeshbhai. Vikram Vedha, could not fare well, notwithstanding the combined might of superstars Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan as the protagonists and despite being the remake of a Tamil blockbuster. And Aamir Khan decided to go on a year-long sabbatical in the wake of Lal Singh Chaddha flopping.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most influential industries, when it comes to production, ticket sales and revenues, Bollywood has also had to face the tough challenge thrown by the South cinema at home. 37% of Hindi box office in 2022 were generated through Hindi dubbed versions of Telugu, Tamil and\u00a0Kannada language films, as per October box office report of Ormax Media. It was all about the sway of the multilingual films that acquired a new, much respected nomenclature\u2014pan-India films. The biggest hit in 2022 has been Kannada film KGF: Chapter 2 amassing an eye popping Rs 970 crore in domestic box office in all the versions (figures as per Ormax October box office report), followed by Telugu RRR at Rs 869 crore, Kannada Kantara with Rs 346 crore and Tamil Ponniyin Selvan: PS I with Rs 323 crore. Hindi cinema manages to enter way down at the fifth spot with Brahmastra.\n\nHowever, this is something that has not come about overnight but is the culmination of the shift in power taking shape over the last five years in the Indian film industry.\u00a0Hindi cinema might have behaved like the Big Brother with a bigger share of the overall pie, but it was unable to make a dent in the domination of other language cinemas in their own strongholds. Things began turning with the release of Telugu language Baahubali in 2015. Its Hindi version took the audience in North India by storm, challenging Bollywood as a leader in its own home turf. Its sequel in 2017 sealed things further with the Hindi version emerging bigger than any other Hindi language film that year.\n\nThere have been challenges from the other side as well. Hollywood has often been critiqued as the monolith that has been destroying local cinema cultures and homogenising entertainment globally. Bollywood had for long been able to withstand this takeover. However, since the astounding business of \u201cAvengers Endgame\u201d in 2019 (Rs 433 crore in all the language versions) it has been gaining ground as well. In 2022 Top Gun Maverick, Dr Strange in Multiverse of Madness and The Batman fared better than a lot of big Hindi releases.\u00a0Avatar: The Way of the Water had raked in Rs 129 crore since its release mid-December (as per trade website Bollywood Hungama) to possibly become bigger than some of the Bollywood hits.\n\nTo be fair it\u2019s not the first time that Bollywood has been crisis-hit. In recent times, it had faced a slump in 2002, the year when nothing seemed to work except three films \u2013 Devdas, Raaz and Kaante. But never have the odds felt so irredeemably against it with the industry under siege and losing confidence. No upcoming film is sparking interest and excitement, not just for the audience but the industry insiders as well.\n\nAccording to a report by Ormax Media\u2019s Gautam Jain, while only a handful of Hindi films delivered at the box office in 2022, the situation had not been very different for films in Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada or Telugu. \u201cIn fact, the Telugu film industry had to halt production for a few weeks to go back to the drawing board, taking cognisance of the under-performance,\u201d he writes.\n\nThere have been some obvious practical constraints for films not doing well. Going out to watch a film as a family is not financially viable anymore. \u201cMiddle class does not have the money to splurge on expensive multiplex tickets, popcorn and cold drinks. Where is the spending power?\u201d asked Kashyap, factoring in economic downturn, inflation, slide in income and rising unemployment in the country, especially in the wake of COVID.\n\nNational Cinema Day, observed in India in September when film tickets were sold across the country for Rs 75 (less than a dollar), did meet with success. However, it seemed like a one-off event, not financially viable for theatres on a regular basis.\n\nThe tale of woes hardly ends at theatrical returns tanking. Lucrative deals through premieres on streaming platforms that helped producers make partial recovery during the pandemic also crashed with films not getting sold as easily. With the shorter gap (of four weeks) between the theatrical and streaming releases, there had been an assumption in the audience that they\u2019d be able to see any film at home in a month\u2019s time so why venture out for it. That has been increased to eight weeks to give theatrical run a fair chance. So, Laal Singh Chaddha dropped on Netflix in early October, but its makers, banking on big theatrical returns (which was not to be), were hoping for a window of six months or so between the two.\n\nIn the two years of the pandemic, with nowhere to go, the middle class, theatre-going audience in India has become a stay-at-home consumer, discovering streaming platforms and the wealth of content online, not just from within India but overseas as well. Korean dramas, popularly known as K-dramas, have found a ready audience in those who have grown up on Indian melodramas and romances but aren\u2019t able to find the magic anymore. Malayalam language films from the South Indian state of Kerala have been satiating the cinephiles with their out-of-the-box ideas and interesting engagement with issues of the day; by not just picking great stories but also telling them well.\u00a0Viewers of Bollywood have become exposed to better content, are spoilt for choice and hence more demanding.\n\nAccording to columnist, author and MD and CEO of Future Brands, Santosh Desai, there has been a disruption in Hindi cinema\u2019s connection with the middle class and family audiences. Also with liberalisation, globalisation, a steady marginalisation of the single screen theatres and growth in the number of multiplexes have ensured that an urban sensibility has begun reflect in the stories, characters and settings of the films. Bollywood began thriving in its own bubble and lost touch with reality and the masses. It was creating fantasies about impossibly beautiful people living in picturesque locales; their only problem in life being whether to eat the cake and have it too. The small towns and villages took a backseat, as did the villagers and the farmers. It could also well be this absence of relatability that has had the audience deserting it, unable to see anything of consequence for themselves in the films but finding that in the earthy, rooted films from the South instead.\n\nNow the Hindi film audience largely comprises young men and the cinema they appear to patronise is masculine and testosterone-driven to boot. \u201cA Jayeshbhai feels a meek misfit in the aggressive male RRR, Pushpa, KGF universe that has been dominating now,\u201d said Amul V\u00a0Mohan, a Mumbai-based producer and trade expert. However well-meaning the film might be, a mild-mannered hero who questions patriarchy (in the case of Jayeshbhai, female infanticide) is suddenly an anomaly in the predominant, hyper-macho blueprint of success these days in which women are either entirely absent or incidental.\u00a0What\u2019s more, the unbridled masculinity and machismo in contemporary Bollywood has also been drawing significantly from the predominant patriotic fervour and aggressive Hindu religious iconography and sensibility, be it a Brahmastra, Ram Setu, or the forthcoming Adipurush.\n\n\u201cThe element of surprise has gone from Hindi cinema. The audience can itself write the script of most of the films it sees,\u201d said TV producer, director and author Nasreen Munni Kabir. The lack of inspiration and imagination in filmmakers, sheer laziness and complacency, turning filmmaking into a profession rather than passion and falling back on the safety of all that has worked in the past could be the reasons films are looking and feeling jaded now.\n\nA lot of good actors, directors and writers are moving to streaming platforms that are green lighting fresher content. However, filmmaker Dibakar Banerjee isn\u2019t so gung-ho about it. According to him, it\u2019s not about revival of meaningful content or freedom of expression but about survival, catching eyeballs, and creating addiction; in other words, the focus is on binge-watching.\u00a0The fear of state-backed retribution and repression and censorship of content has been growing following the case of Amazon Prime\u2019s original Tandav, an Indian political thriller web series that was released in 2019, where the makers were accused of hurting religious sentiments of the audience. Banerjee\u2019s own Netflix original Tees is stuck in a limbo because of the platform\u2019s worries about how it might be received in the current socio-political situation in India.\n\nThe audience hostility is not just confined to rejecting Hindi films. Over the past three years the industry has also been pummelled in other ways. Just like the polarised Indian social fabric, the supposedly \u201csecular\u201d industry too has found itself getting split wide open ideologically. \u201cBollywood is being dismissed and denigrated by association by calling it names like as Dawoodwood (Dawood Ibrahim being the most wanted mafia don in Mumbai),\u201d said an industry insider.\n\nBacklash and bans emerged as the other big bane in 2022. Timed with the Laal Singh Chaddha release, #BoycottAamir began to trend on Twitter which many feel may have contributed to the adverse business of the film. Now the first big film of 2023, Pathaan, that marks Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s return to big screen after Zero in 2018, is facing music over a song in which an offensive saffron coloured bikini appears for less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe fringe has become slightly more mainstream. It has become easy to offend and get offended. Bollywood continues to be the easy target,\u201d said an industry insider. All for being highly visible and just as vulnerable when it comes to the business interest and the millions riding on it. \u201cThe mob has gone beyond its leaders. It is on its own now and much more dangerous,\u201d said writer-director filmmaker Vasan Bala.\n\n\u201cBoycott is not an isolated instance. It has been getting solidified in the past 2-3 years,\u201d says an industry insider. Even the most minor things can offend which then gets magnified on Twitter through hashtag wars. Trending topics become fodder for stories in the media and trickle down to Facebook posts and Whatsapp forwards, which get amplified on the ground, building aversion for films.\n\nAccording to Desai, the boycott calls, earlier assumed to not affect materially, are clearly going beyond Twitter and playing a larger role now. \u201cThings are changing. Political dialogue is infecting the social and artistic sphere,\u201d said Desai. Ironically, even Adipurush, based on the Ramayana, found itself at the receiving end of the fury for its alleged inaccurate portrayal of Hindu gods. Actor Saif Ali Khan was particularly targeted for his \u201cMughal era\u201d inspired getup of \u201cthe staunch Hindu brahmin\u201d Ravana, the chief antagonist of the Hindu epic.\n\nThe backlash against the industry has also been growing since the death by suicide case of young actor Sushant Singh Rajput in 2020 which was surrounded in rumours and speculation and was a subject of widespread and often unsubstantiated media coverage. From supposed preponderance of drugs to nepotism, Bollywood came at the receiving end for his mental health issues. A continual narrative has since been getting built around the supposed sleaziness and amorality in the industry. \u201cThere has been a systematic character assassination with the industry deliberately associated with drugs, alcohol, parties, vanity and sex,\u201d said an industry insider.\n\n\u201cEarlier I might have been one in ten facing adversity, now all are,\u201d says Banerjee. But he isn\u2019t surprised by this turn of events. \u201cBollywood has been kowtowing to the political masters, it is beholden to the very forces it was once trying to seduce \u2026 It has been supine. We let it happen. We never stood up for anything. We have been sycophantic power grabbers,\u201d he said.\n\nMany feel that the bubble had to burst one day and are hopeful that some changes and growth for the better might emerge from this slide. Experts are advocating a systemic rehaul and radical makeover that involves rationalizing budgets, reorienting the star system, focusing on content, selling it at a reasonable price to maximize returns and, also a correction in ticket pricing. \u201cThere will be a degree of trial and error but what Bollywood needs to do is put out a lot of content of all kinds and with varied marketing strategies,\u201d said Rathi.\n\nWhile Bollywood has become corporatised, professionalised and disciplined over the last decade or more, it still hasn\u2019t accorded the rightful respect, primacy and passion to content. The scripts might be ready and bound before the shoot unlike the earlier days when they were put together on the set, however, scriptwriters, the backbone of filmmaking, need to be given their rightful place in the sun. There was a time back in the \u201950s when studios had strong linkages with litterateurs and used to nurture young talent. That patronage is missing now in all but a handful of places.\n\nOn the other hand, stars don't necessarily ensure hits despite accounting for 30-40% of a film's cost. \u201cThey have devalued themselves. They have lost the magic and the mystique by being desperate for attention on social media,\u201d said Kabir. \u201cThe stars in the South don\u2019t flaunt wealth, cars or fashion. They only live for their films. In Bollywood, stars have turned even coming out of the airport into content [uploaded on social media],\u201d said Bala. Every bit of their life plays out on Instagram, and it has grown manifold in the past two years. What was initially seen as a way of staying in touch with the fans has led to an overkill. Why would there be any more excitement then to see them on the big screen when they are a push of the button away on our mobiles?\n\nAccording to writer-lyricist Hussain Haidry, we might talk a lot about cinema being magic and collective hypnosis but can\u2019t fool people all the time. \u201cThe old syntax of a blockbuster needs to change,\u201d he said. A blockbuster does not necessarily have to be big budget, backed by a leading studio, headlined by stars, of a sweeping scale, trying to cater to every member of the audience with larger-than-life emotions and entertainment. It must be packaged anew. Even a small film on love across class and caste divides, with unknown actors, like Nagraj Manjule\u2019s Marathi language Sairat, which came out of nowhere in 2016, made it big with the sheer freshness of its telling.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the industry lacks talent. Banerjee sees hope in filmmakers working away from the star system, telling surprising stories, often from the interiors of India and beyond their personal comfort zones. The indefatigable wouldn\u2019t just give up the fight. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to put the last nail on the coffin. Bollywood would have to just wait it out and ride the wave,\u201d said Mohan. \u201cIt\u2019s not about one push, one day, one scene, one dialogue. It\u2019s a Leviathan we are up against,\u201d said Chohan. One Brahmastra or Drishyam 2 might ring in hope for the days to come but shouldn\u2019t make the industry fall right back on its old ways. It will have to change totally. Power will need to be redistributed. New voices will have to come up. As Chohan summed it up: \u201cBollywood will have to embrace a new normal.\u201d","title":"Bollywood in 2022","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmVtYWV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2hpbmRpL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMjMvamFuLzAxL3RoZS1iaWctcGljdHVyZS1ib2xseXdvb2QtaW4tMjAyMi0zODI1MC5odG1s0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmNpbmVtYWV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2hpbmRpL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMjMvamFuLzAxL3RoZS1iaWctcGljdHVyZS1ib2xseXdvb2QtaW4tMjAyMi0zODI1MC5hbXA?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Sheela Bhatt"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/from-the-india-today-archives-1994-dawood-ibrahim-i-had-nothing-to-do-with-yakub-memon-never-seen-his-face-1999385-2022-09-12","copyright":"2023 Living Media India Limited","date":"2022-09-12T11:14:00.000Z","description":"The \u2018beautification\u2019 of 1993 Bombay blasts case convict Yakub Memon\u2019s grave in Mumbai has led to a blame game among political parties.

Why should I send him? I had nothing to do with him. I've never even seen his face.\n\nQ. Did you ask Yakub to surrender so that he could clear your name?\n\nA. Yakub is with you. Why not ask him? I was thinking about clearing my name when I received the news. Remember, Yakub made the statement on TV in front of the whole nation that he has not met me.\n\nQ. So how come he appears to be clearing you of all charges?\n\nA. The man who clears me of all charges will not be believed. If someone who knows says Dawood Ibrahim is innocent, then they say he has taken money from Dawood. An officer with whom I had a lot of discussions regarding this matter told me: \"It is my firm belief that you are not involved in this case. If I want to say anything today, I will have to resign first. And if I don't resign, they will suspend me.\"\n\nQ. But surely your name does not figure all the time without a reason?\n\nA. That is due to political reasons. Ask them what's the evidence against me. To know somebody is not a crime. I think I am a victim of the politics of Sharad Pawar and S. B. Chavan.\n\nQ. But the charge is that Pawar is a friend of yours.\n\nA. We are neither friends nor foes. When the press started hollering that Pawar had links with Dawood, the chief minister ordered the police to involve me in the case. But Chavan wants - now that I have already been maligned - to establish my involvement in the case and then prove that I had links with Pawar. This will provide him with all the ammunition to dislodge Pawar easily. So, they're both trying to frame me for their own vested interests.\n\nQ. Where were you on March 12, 1993, the day of the Bombay blasts?\n\nA. I was at home and flooded by phone calls - from Sindhis, Muslims, Gujaratis. I was shocked beyond words. But when the car was found, I was relieved at the thought that some evidence was found and there was no reason to be afraid. I thought that now truth will prevail any moment. Suddenly I learnt that a man named Dawood Taklu had mentioned my name during interrogation. Till then, newspapers were questioning Bombay Police chief Samra about my involvement. He could not say anything. Just because of one man mentioning my name, I have a tarnished image.\n\nQ. Did you know Tiger Memon?\n\nA. He used to come to Dubai very often. But I didn't have any personal relationship or business deal with him. I know him the way I know every Bombayite who indulges in uncha neecha dhanda (shady deals). I have met him a number of times.\n\nQ. But Tiger and you have the same kind of business.\n\nA. Ask the police to take out Tiger Memon's record and draw conclusions whether I had any connection with him. If the record proves it, then you are free to bring whatever charges you want to against me.\n\nQ. Are you saying that you had no hand in the Bombay blasts?\n\nA. Yes, believe me, mein dil cheer kar toh nahin dikha sakta. I had no connection whatsoever with the blasts.\n\nQ. Yakub Memon is saying that the blasts were masterminded by the ISI. What is your relation with the ISI and with Taufiq Jaliawala?\n\nA. I know nothing about the ISI. And, as far as Jaliawala is concerned, I have known him as a businessman in Dubai for the last 10 years.\n\nQ. We now know that Jaliawala is an ISI man. Were you aware of that?\n\nA. If I had known that he was an ISI man, why should I attend his wedding when my name was being hauled into the bomb blasts case? Or why should I allow myself to appear on the video recording of the marriage?\n\nQ. You know Tiger Memon, Jaliawala and the Bombay underworld. Do you think the Bombay blasts were caused by Pakistan and the Memons?\n\nA. I think Tiger Memon is involved because his own brother is saying so.\n\nQ. But Tiger alone couldn't have pulled off such a big thing. How do you back your claim of innocence?\n\nA. Tiger and his brother, who are behind the blasts, are the people best placed to tell you what had happened.\n\nQ. You're charged with the murder of over 300 people in the blasts. The investigation is pointing towards you.\n\nA. Well, I am prepared to work hard to prove my innocence. But I can't be forced to say things that I don't know.\n\nQ. Your network was the strongest in western India when the blasts took place.\n\nA. And how many of my men were involved in the blasts?\n\nQ. We have to believe what the police say. But if you want to prove your innocence, you'll have to say who were involved.\n\nA. When Tiger Memon is involved in the case, what else can I say?\n\nQ. Who is behind Tiger?\n\nA. Why don't you ask his brother?\n\nQ. Why don't you surrender if you are innocent?\n\nA. I am not fond of committing suicide. The police had framed me even before starting the investigation, and later on started producing evidence against me. I can never attempt such a dastardly act in my life. Even if I had, this is not the way I would have gone about it. I would have dealt with those who instigate violence and riots, not the ordinary people.\n\nQ. You may not have executed the blasts, but did you finance them?\n\nA. I didn't give a single penny. Look, I am into gang wars and smuggling, how was I to know about this type of plans.\n\nQ. But they used the smuggling network, the people who have some knowledge about such operations.\n\nA. What the hell are you saying? Stop arguing like the police. I am in a desperate situation. They have reduced me to a mouse. I am trapped and cannot move around freely.\n\nQ. Yakub has also said that you are involved with Jaliawala.\n\nA. That Jaliawala is a businessman and a smuggler. I maintain a good friendship with everyone in Dubai. Just because I am a Muslim, does it mean I shouldn't talk to a Pakistani?\n\nQ. Do you think that Jaliawala is the man behind the blasts?\n\nA. I had never heard about his involvement. In fact I was surprised when I came to know of it.\n\nQ. Are you under scrutiny in Dubai?\n\nA. People in Dubai support me. But the pressures from India, I mean the allegations, only confuse people. The Indian media has already painted me black. And they write only what the Government says.\n\nQ. Do you have any properties in Bombay?\n\nA. They are there - the ones that are of my parents, my brothers.\n\nQ. What about benami property?\n\nA. Why, isn't there any other place than Bombay to own benami property? When I can legally own property, why should I go in for benami? Why should I leave property worth crores of rupees in someone else's name?\n\nQ. People think you are Pawar's man.\n\nA. No, I am not Pawar's man. Neither do I have any relation with Chavan. If you think Pawar is the guardian of my property, then you people take it. I am prepared to give it in writing.\n\nQ. It is said your sentiments were hurt due to the Bombay riots and that you wanted to take revenge...\n\nA. The world was moved by those riots, why do you talk about me alone? But there was nothing about taking revenge. There have been many riots in India before. Is there any police record which says that I was involved in any one of them?\n\nQ. So why are the police implicating you in the case?\n\nA. Because I am a Muslim. I have a name in the community. But leave alone me, even if a Muslim bhangi (sweeper) happens to be well known, they won't tolerate it.\n\nQ. Who won't tolerate it?\n\nA. Those who are communal.\n\nQ. Such as?\n\nA. There are many, like Bal Thackeray. Just see, he openly says, \"we have demolished the mosque\". Because of this 600 lives were lost. He moves around scot free. And here I am, saying I have not caused the blasts, but just because I'm a Muslim nobody believes me.\n\nQ. After the Bombay riots, you sought to take revenge on Hindus by instigating Muslim militants. A meeting took place at your residence on January 10, 1993.\n\nA. The atmosphere was very sensitive and people were tense. In Dubai also, there were meetings for the relief of the victims. You interpret such a meeting as that of the planning of the blasts.\n\nQ. Are you saying you didn't participate in the meeting at your home?\n\nA. The times were such. In Dubai this was the hot topic. The whole world would be talking about Bombay. I have never seen RDX in my life.\n\nQ. It is ridiculous to accept your version at face value. Why then are you a prime accused?\n\nA. This is a Chavan-Pawar feud in which I have become a pawn. The Bombay police have linked my name with the blasts to establish the fact that I am not from the Pawar camp. There is no case on me. It is just politics.\n\nQ. Tell us once and for all, do you have any relations with Pawar?\n\nA. If I had any relations with him, he could have saved me.\n\nQ. You had links previously, through Bhai Thakur.\n\nA. Please stop all this. Do not try to trap me.\n\nQ. Tell us something about your personal life.\n\nA. I studied up to SSC in Urdu medium. I have been married for the past nine years and I have one boy and three daughters.\n\nQ. What is your current income?\n\nA. I have sufficient money from the past. Do you want a donation?\n\nQ. Do you donate funds to political parties?\n\nA. Not to just the Congress(I). I donate to all parties.\n\nQ. Do you have contacts in Delhi?\n\nA. Why are you asking me this? I am already in trouble. Let me clear out of this first, then I can talk to you about other things.\n\nQ. The Indian Government says you are in Pakistan.\n\nA. The Indian Government is always saying something or the other. I do not stay in Pakistan but I keep visiting the country frequently.\n\nQ. Do you stay in Pakistan?\n\nA. Why are you after me? Let me live in peace. Let me have a roof above me. I keep going to Pakistan.\n\nQ. But how? You can't travel like an ordinary man.\n\nA. You want to bet, you choose any place in the world and I'll meet you there.\n\nQ. But you can't go to London or Geneva because India has signed extradition treaties.\n\nA. I do not go anywhere officially. What is your problem if I go to any place? I always go to a place where there is no extradition treaty.\n\nQ. As seen in a recent photograph of yours, you have drastically changed your looks. Why?\n\nA. Nothing has changed. Only the moustache is no longer there.\n\nQ. Why not talk to the press if you are innocent as you claim? Khairnar is talking to everybody.\n\nA. Khairnar is talking to everybody and he has also been provided with official security. And the world knows the lies he is telling.\n\nQ. What are these lies?\n\nA. Whenever he demolishes any building, he says he has demolished a Dawood building. And thinks any property worth crores of rupees is Dawoods. He is not an imbecile. He is something more than that - he has demolished one Dawood building and under the pretext of demolishing other buildings owned by Dawood, he has razed buildings of a hundred Muslims in Bombay. Look at the atrocities he has committed on Muslims.\n\nQ. Do you think that India has gone communal?\n\nA. Yes. Some of them have become communal.\n\nQ. Such as?\n\nA. Bal Thackeray and the Bombay Police are totally communal. They are after me because I am a Muslim. Nobody has earned such a name and that is why they are trying to suppress me. Some of them are afraid that I may become a top leader of the Muslims.\n\nQ. What difference have the accusations made to your lifestyle?\n\nA. Nothing at all. Only that, I ask myself why this injustice is perpetrated on me. I move around normally. You have seen my recent photographs and I am sure you have found me looking smart in them.\n\nQ. What do you want now?\n\nA. Justice. I want justice in front of the Indian public. At the rate at which the police is progressing, I doubt if I will get any justice. I prefer to be tried in a neutral country. Death will come and it will come only once. I am not afraid. But I am afraid of wrong evidence. I am telling you once again that the investigation of the police is false. I have read the long chargesheet of the case, where I came to know that the people accused have said that they had come to Dubai and met me. I have 2,000 men in India. Couldn't I have sent any one of them to these people, or couldn't I have talked to any of them on the phone?\n\nQ. So do you claim to be a clean guy?\n\nA. No. I am not saying that I am a pandit from the temple nor a mullah. I am bad, but not as bad as the government has made me out to be. I am not an angel nor an avatar. Even then, I repeat that I am not involved in the case. I also believe that the Bombay blast case has been solved. The CBI knows everything.","title":"Dawood Ibrahim: \u201cI had nothing to do with Yakub Memon, never seen his face\u201d","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2luZGlhLXRvZGF5LWluc2lnaHQvc3RvcnkvZnJvbS10aGUtaW5kaWEtdG9kYXktYXJjaGl2ZXMtMTk5NC1kYXdvb2QtaWJyYWhpbS1pLWhhZC1ub3RoaW5nLXRvLWRvLXdpdGgteWFrdWItbWVtb24tbmV2ZXItc2Vlbi1oaXMtZmFjZS0xOTk5Mzg1LTIwMjItMDktMTLSAbUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvaW5kaWEtdG9kYXktaW5zaWdodC9zdG9yeS9mcm9tLXRoZS1pbmRpYS10b2RheS1hcmNoaXZlcy0xOTk0LWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLWktaGFkLW5vdGhpbmctdG8tZG8td2l0aC15YWt1Yi1tZW1vbi1uZXZlci1zZWVuLWhpcy1mYWNlLTE5OTkzODUtMjAyMi0wOS0xMg?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Bhavana"],"canonicalLink":"https://newsmeter.in/entertainment/hit-2-to-mumbai-mafia-here-are-movies-making-ott-debut-this-weekend-706164","copyright":null,"date":"2023-01-06T10:30:47.000Z","description":"Family audiences who couldn't go to the theaters can watch the film right from the comfort of their home.","favicon":"/images/ico/favicon.ico?v=1","image":"https://newsmeter.in/h-upload/2023/01/06/336416-2023-01-06-121156.jpg","keywords":"OTTMovies, weekend, HIT2, Mumbai Mafia","lang":"en","links":[],"loadedUrl":"https://newsmeter.in/entertainment/hit-2-to-mumbai-mafia-here-are-movies-making-ott-debut-this-weekend-706164","publisher":null,"softTitle":"HIT 2 to Mumbai Mafia: Here are movies making OTT debut this weekend","tags":["OTTMovies","weekend","HIT2","Mumbai Mafia"],"text":"Hyderabad: Many films that hit the screens in the first week of December 2022 are all set for OTT debut.\n\nHere is the list of those films which are streaming on OTT from today.\n\nStarring Adivi Sesh and Meenakshi Chaudhary in lead roles, HIT 2 is directed by Sailesh Kolanu and is produced by Nani.

Fruit and Bhati also were produced before the court and were remanded to police custody till October 15.\n\nThe FIR against Fruit and Bhati was based on a complaint filed by a Versova-based businessman, who had come in contact with Bhati last year. In February 2021, he allegedly met Bhati at a hotel where he was introduced to Fruit.\n\nThe complainant, who liked playing cards, met with Fruit at a place in Matunga for the same. On the first day, Fruit \u2014 who lost to the complainant \u2014 said that he did not have money on him, and would pay the same later.\n\nSubsequently, during another gambling session, Fruit won the game and told the complainant that he owed him Rs 62 lakh.

The devil was preying upon the City of Dreams. The perpetrators of the December 1992 and January 1993 riots were, by and large, known to everyone, but the brain behind these serial blasts was still a mystery. The blasts raised questions over the security of Bombay and the competence of Indian intelligence agencies to pre-empt such strikes.\n\nThe Bombay Police began a rapid investigation and got its first clue within forty-eight hours of the blasts. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Rakesh Maria was informed about an explosive laden scooter recovered at Dadar. The scooter led him to a flat at the Al Hussaini building near the Mahim police station.\n\nIt was locked up. The neighbours informed him that the flat was registered in the name of Mushtaque Memon, who was better known as Tiger, the smuggler. Tiger stayed in the flat with his extended family, which included his parents, brothers Yakub, Yusuf, Essa, Ayub and Suleiman, and their wives.\n\nEveryone believed Tiger had links with Dawood Ibrahim. Maria broke into the flat and found a key that fit the scooter recovered from Dadar. More links were found. Neighbours told Maria that Tiger had not been seen since 11 March. He had fled the country with his family hours before the blasts, but many people associated with the conspiracy were still in India. A manhunt began. Maria formed a team of 162 officers of varied ranks to investigate the case. The team spread across seventy-nine towns and cities in India, and arrested 189 suspects, most of whom were poor people associated with Tiger or his henchmen for different reasons.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, a shocking truth was uncovered: the Pakistani intelligence agency, Inter Service Intelligence (ISI), was behind the blasts. To execute the conspiracy, the ISI used the resources and manpower of Dawood Ibrahim, who had escaped from India six years earlier and was now operating from Dubai. Although there was no extradition treaty between India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the strengthening of diplomatic relations between the two countries worried Dawood. Meanwhile, the Bombay riots made the ISI\u2019s job easier. It was reported that Dawood received messages from Muslims in Bombay to avenge the riots.\n\nHe was informed about the Shiv Sena\u2019s role and the police\u2019s biased approach. The ISI offered Dawood a quid pro quo deal to \u2018avenge\u2019 the Bombay riots for his help in executing their plan. The ISI promised to provide a safe harbour for him, his family and cronies in Pakistan, from where he could run his gang fearlessly. The ISI wanted Dawood to use his network of corrupt police and customs officials, who helped him smuggle gold and silver into India, to traffic explosives and weapons into Bombay. A series of meetings was organized in Dubai, which were attended by ISI agents; Dawood\u2019s brother, Anees Ibrahim; and Tiger Memon.\n\nThe Shiv Sainiks had burnt down Tiger Memon\u2019s office in Mahim during the riots, and the blasts offered him an opportunity to avenge his personal loss. But what confused investigators was the fact that the bomb blast at Zaveri Bazaar took place just outside Tiger Memon\u2019s beautiful glass building, which was shattered. Three days after the serial blasts, it became clear to the Bombay Police that Tiger Memon had executed the conspiracy. Although Tiger had escaped, the police apprehended the bomb-planters, who further revealed how the RDX and the weapons dispatched by the ISI landed at the Raigadh coast near Bombay with the help of customs and police officials.\n\nFurther investigation showed that the plan to rock Bombay had begun right after the January riots. While select people were sent to Pakistan, others were trained in nearby rural areas. Most were semi-literate and poor twenty and thirty-year-olds with a criminal record. Some were the sole breadwinners of their families. While covering the trial at the special court set up under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) in the late \u201990s and the early years of the twenty-first century, I interacted with a few of them. They were full of bitterness towards Tiger. One of the accused confessed, \u2018People like us could be easily misled under the circumstances. The Bombay riots infuriated us and Tiger capitalized on our anger. At present, while he relaxes in Pakistan, our families have been destroyed. I don\u2019t know if I will ever be able to lead a free life.\u2019\n\nThis excerpt from Jitendra Dixit\u2019s \u2018Bombay After Ayodhya\u2019 has been published with permission from Harper Collins India.","title":"\u2018He used our rage against us\u2019\u2014How Dawood Ibrahim destroyed Bombay in 1993 serial blasts","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL3BhZ2V0dXJuZXIvZXhjZXJwdC9oZS11c2VkLW91ci1yYWdlLWFnYWluc3QtdXMtaG93LWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLWRlc3Ryb3llZC1ib21iYXktaW4tMTk5My1zZXJpYWwtYmxhc3RzLzEyNDc2NDQv0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vcGFnZXR1cm5lci9leGNlcnB0L2hlLXVzZWQtb3VyLXJhZ2UtYWdhaW5zdC11cy1ob3ctZGF3b29kLWlicmFoaW0tZGVzdHJveWVkLWJvbWJheS1pbi0xOTkzLXNlcmlhbC1ibGFzdHMvMTI0NzY0NC8_YW1w?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Updated Date: November 22, 2022 21:37:37 IST"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.firstpost.com/india/dawood-ibrahim-has-sent-two-assassins-to-kill-pm-modi-mentally-disturbed-mans-hoax-call-puts-mumbai-police-on-alert-11677231.html","copyright":"2023","date":"2022-11-22T15:58:32.000Z","description":"Earlier this month, the police received a hoax call claiming the presence of terrorists in the Haji Ali Dargah area in Mumbai.

The police registered a first information report (FIR) at the Oshiwara police station and then transferred it to the Anti Extortion Cell (AEC), which took Bhati in custody for interrogation.\n\nLast month, the AEC arrested Bhati in connection with another extortion case in which gangster Chhota Shakeel\u2019s brother-in-law Salim Qureshi alias Salim Fruit is also an accused. Once his custody in that case got over, the AEC took his custody in connection with this case.\n\nAn officer said the complainant said he and Riyaz Bhati, along with four others, had floated a company and taken up the development of a property in Oshiwara. After they could not complete the development work, a complaint was filed against them and the police arrested Bhati in 2018.\n\nAfter spending six months behind bars, Bhati was released on bail. Once he came out, he started telling the other partners that he had to spend Rs 65 lakh and each of them owed him Rs 12 lakh since they were partners, the complainant alleged.\n\nWhen the complainant did not pay the money, Bhati allegedly made Whatsapp calls to him and threatened to get him arrested or even kill him.","title":"Dawood Ibrahim aide Riyaz Bhati taken into custody for extorting

Now, in the build-up to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, the Shiv Sena chief is invoking the motto as a possible reason to break with the BJP. \"Things are not getting done,\" Uddhav says, impatience writ large on his face. He talks of grudges he holds against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over not being consulted on key policy decisions like demonetisation. He says he feels \"isolated\" in the alliance. Excerpts from an interview with INDIA TODAY\u2019s Kiran D. Tare ahead of the February 2017 BMC polls:\n\nOur unhappiness is limited to the government's policies. It's not a crime for a mahout to use a goad to control the elephant. Can we afford to have the mahout get off, let the elephant run amok? But then if the elephant is out of control, the mahout has to get off it.\n\nThe BJP has assured waiver of farm loans in Uttar Pradesh but it neglects our demand for a similar waiver in Maharashtra. Why can't a financially sound state like Maharashtra waive farmers' loans? The Centre collected a tax of Rs 2 lakh crore from Mumbai this year. We are demanding that the local municipal corporation must get a 25 per cent share of this. The alliance cannot move ahead till they (BJP) respond.\n\nIt is time for people to think about the quality of the government they have elected. They (BJP) have been inducting people with criminal backgrounds. Earlier, (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee and (L. K.) Advani were their faces. Now, Pappu Kalani (a convicted murderer) is their face. If Dawood Ibrahim returns to India, I'm sure BJP will induct him too. They were talking about achhe din, Ram temple, Article 370, uniform civil code. What have they done?\n\nHe was new at the time but it's now clear he's lying. He had promised a Rs 6,500 crore package to Kalyan-Dombivli (in 2015). Not a single paisa has been released. He's not been able to get clearances from the Centre for development of Mumbai's east coast and coastal road. The proposal for converting the racecourse land into a world-class theme park is stuck. His comparison, saying Mumbai was as backward as Patna, is an insult to both the cities.\n\nThe CM will be replaced in 2019. Then it will be a CM from the Shiv Sena.\n\nOf course! In fact, I am willing to form a league of regional parties. Let us have a common minimum programme apart from the pride of every state. If I work for Marathi pride, let Nitish Kumar do it for Bihari pride and Mamata Banerjee for Bengali pride. But we should be together on several subjects.\n\nFirst let them respond to my proposal.\n\nThe Shiv Sena rotted through the 25 years of its alliance with the BJP. We were expanding after the Babri Masjid demolition. However, Balasaheb was of the view that there should not be division in the Hindutva parties, so he allowed the BJP to grow in other states and concentrated on Maharashtra.","title":"If Dawood Ibrahim returns to India, BJP will induct him too: Uddhav Thackeray","url":"https://news.google.com/__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?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["https://www.facebook.com/PressTrustofIndia","Press Trust of India"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.siasat.com/malik-not-innocent-he-was-dealing-with-dawood-ibrahims-sister-ed-to-court-2412966/","copyright":"Siasat Daily","date":"2022-09-14T17:51:43.000Z","description":"ASG Anil Singh, appearing for the ED, made this submission while presenting arguments on Malik's bail plea and seeking its rejection.","image":"https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nawab-Malik-1.jpg","keywords":"Dawood Ibrahim, Enforcement Directorate, Nawab Malik, NCP, NIA","lang":"en","links":[],"loadedUrl":"https://www.siasat.com/malik-not-innocent-he-was-dealing-with-dawood-ibrahims-sister-ed-to-court-2412966/","publisher":"The Siasat Daily","softTitle":"Malik not innocent, he was dealing with Dawood Ibrahim's sister: ED to court","tags":["Dawood Ibrahim","Enforcement Directorate","Nawab Malik","NCP","NIA"],"text":"Mumbai: Former Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik, arrested in a money laundering case, was dealing with fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s sister Hasina Parkar and there was no question of him being innocent, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told a special court here on Wednesday.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, appearing for the ED, made this submission while presenting arguments on Malik\u2019s bail plea and seeking its rejection.\n\nThe 63-year-old Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, currently in jail under judicial custody, was arrested on February 23 under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by the ED in connection with a probe linked to activities of Ibrahim and his aides.\n\nThe ED\u2019s case was based on an FIR (first information report) filed recently by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against Ibrahim, a designated global terrorist and key 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts accused, and his aides under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), an anti-terror act.\n\nAmong others grounds, Malik has sought bail pleading there was no predicate (or scheduled) offence against him to prosecute him for money laundering. A predicate offence under the PMLA is the crime which gives rise to the proceeds of crime\u2019, which are then laundered.\n\nResponding to the claim, the ASG submitted in the special PMLA court that the case registered by the NIA against Ibrahim and his close associates was considered as a predicate offence.\n\nThe anti-money laundering agency has claimed Malik had usurped a property at Goawala Compound in suburban Kurla in active connivance with members of the D-gang (Dawood Ibrahim gang), including Parkar.\n\nThe ASG further submitted that as per the NIA case, Ibrahim is a terrorist and all his criminal activities were being handled by his sister Parkar after he left India. \u201cIn the case against Malik, Parkar was involved. The business of Parkar was to settle property disputes and make money out of them. She entered Goawala Compound to settle matters and her own son has said in his statement that she owned the property (that was later acquired by the former minister),\u201d Singh said.\n\nSardar Khan, an eyewitness in the case, has mentioned in his statement about Malik meeting Parkar and giving money to her, Singh argued to back his claim of the NCP leader having links with the sister of Ibrahim.\n\n\u201cMalik was dealing with Parkar so there was no question of him being innocent. He knew this was a tainted property. They still had a meeting with her and reflected on property worth crores in lakhs, to cover up, and execute certain documents,\u201d he said.\n\nMerely because some document was executed it does not make the tainted property untainted, the ASG argued while praying for rejection of Malik\u2019s bail plea.","title":"Malik not innocent, he was dealing with Dawood Ibrahim's sister","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20vbWFsaWstbm90LWlubm9jZW50LWhlLXdhcy1kZWFsaW5nLXdpdGgtZGF3b29kLWlicmFoaW1zLXNpc3Rlci1lZC10by1jb3VydC0yNDEyOTY2L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20vbWFsaWstbm90LWlubm9jZW50LWhlLXdhcy1kZWFsaW5nLXdpdGgtZGF3b29kLWlicmFoaW1zLXNpc3Rlci1lZC10by1jb3VydC0yNDEyOTY2L2FtcC8?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Divyesh Singh"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chargesheet-filed-by-ed-against-dawood-ibrahim-s-brother-iqbal-kaskar-in-money-laundering-case-1938492-2022-04-17","copyright":"2022 Living Media India Limited","date":"2022-04-17T08:16:00.000Z","description":"A chargesheet has been filed by the Enforcement Directorate against fugitive underworld gangster Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar in a money laundering case.","favicon":"https://www.indiatoday.in/favicon.ico","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202204/iqbal-kaskar-file.jpg?VersionId=H0wNxnt9f3VKQkPcSHcgl1gPhYhHNsRi","keywords":"Iqbal kaskar, Dawood ibrahim, ED case, ","lang":"en","links":[{"href":"/author/divyesh-singh","text":"<b>By Divyesh Singh</b>"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/crime/story/ed-attaches-flat-worth-rs-55-lakh-in-extortion-case-against-dawood-ibrahim-s-brother-1936587-2022-04-12","text":"have also been named in the chargesheet"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/iqbal-kaskar-ed-custody-money-laundering-case-dawood-ibrahim-1914918-2022-02-18","text":"Dawood Ibrahim&apos;s brother Iqbal Kaskar sent to ED custody till Feb 24 in money laundering case"}],"loadedUrl":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chargesheet-filed-by-ed-against-dawood-ibrahim-s-brother-iqbal-kaskar-in-money-laundering-case-1938492-2022-04-17","publisher":"India Today","softTitle":"ED files chargesheet against Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar in money laundering case","tags":[],"text":"By Divyesh Singh: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently filed a chargesheet against fugitive underworld gangster Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar.

Several films like Satya, Company, Vaastav, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Agneepath, and Daddy have showcased the life of gangsters. However, when dug deeper into it, the relationship was symbiotic.\n\nJust as the film industry was obsessed with crime syndicates, the Mumbai underworld was obsessed with the glitz, glamour, and fame. However, things changed when a series of brazen and brutal attacks on the Bollywood fraternity left a lasting image in everyone\u2019s mind. So let\u2019s take a look at some of the incidences where both crossed paths.\n\nMamta was one of the popular actresses of her time. She rose to fame with films like China Gate, Karan Arjun, Waqt Hamara Hai, and Krantiveer. However, after Kabhie Tum Kabhie Hum, she quit the industry and run off with Vikram Goswami to live anonymously in Dubai. Vikram has cases of money laundering and drug dealing against him, and the couple was arrested in 2016 in Kenya.\n\nMonica Bedi is known for participating in Bigg Boss 2, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 2, and playing the role of Gumaan Kaur Vyas in Saraswatichandra. But more than that, she made headlines when she was arrested in September 2002 with dreaded terrorist and gangster Abu Salem. Several reports claimed that Abu Salem helped coerced a lot of directors into casting her in their movies, giving her a leg up in the industry.\n\nBollywood filmmakers have often made films based on one of the most dreaded gangsters of the underworld Haji Mastan. One of the films was Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s Deewar. Even he had planned his own foray into films with an aptly named Patalganga. However, much to his disappointment the film never took off. It is also worth pointing out that he had a distinct fondness for the legendary actress Madhubala. When he found someone who resembled Madhubala, he married her in a heartbeat. His wife\u2019s name was Sona.\n\nProbably one of the most infamous affairs in the history of Bollywood and underworld association. Mandakini is known for her dancing under a waterfall in the song Ram Teri Ganga Maili. The D Company at that financed a lot of films had used his influence to cast her in films.\n\nThe veteran actor had admitted that he met the gangster years ago. Even pictures of him with gangland leader found its way into a magazine which led the officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation to come calling.\n\nMust Read: The Kashmir Files Over RRR For Oscars\u2019 Decision Of Anurag Kashyap Slammed By Vivek Agnihotri, Calls Him \u201cVicious Genocide-Denier Lobby Of Bollywood\u201d","title":"From Monica Bedi's Relationship With Abu Salem To Anil Kapoor Meeting Dawood Ibrahim, Top 5 'Bollywood Meets Underworld' Stories That Went Viral!","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiswFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2ltb2kuY29tL2JvbGx5d29vZC1uZXdzL2Zyb20tbW9uaWNhLWJlZGlzLXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcC13aXRoLWFidS1zYWxlbS10by1hbmlsLWthcG9vci1tZWV0aW5nLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLXRvcC01LWJvbGx5d29vZC1tZWV0cy11bmRlcndvcmxkLXN0b3JpZXMtdGhhdC13ZW50LXZpcmFsL9IBtwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2ltb2kuY29tL2JvbGx5d29vZC1uZXdzL2Zyb20tbW9uaWNhLWJlZGlzLXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcC13aXRoLWFidS1zYWxlbS10by1hbmlsLWthcG9vci1tZWV0aW5nLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLXRvcC01LWJvbGx5d29vZC1tZWV0cy11bmRlcndvcmxkLXN0b3JpZXMtdGhhdC13ZW50LXZpcmFsL2FtcC8?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Divyesh SinghVidya"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/iqbal-kaskar-ed-custody-money-laundering-case-dawood-ibrahim-1914918-2022-02-18","copyright":"2023 Living Media India Limited","date":"2022-02-18T15:43:00.000Z","description":"Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar has been sent to ED custody till February 24 for allegedly working for the underworld don and handling his gang activities and illegal business interests in Mumbai and other areas.","favicon":"https://www.indiatoday.in/favicon.ico","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202202/kaskar.jpg","keywords":"dawood ibrahim, iqbal kaskar, dawood ibrahim brother, chota shakeel, kaska ed probe, dawood ibrahim arrest","lang":"en","links":[{"href":"/author/divyesh-singh","text":"<b>By Divyesh Singh</b>"},{"href":"/author/vidya","text":"<b>Vidya </b>"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/money-laundering-case-court-issues-production-warrant-against-dawood-ibrahim-s-brother-iqbal-kaskar-1913924-2022-02-16","text":"money laundering case against underworld don and fugitive Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/abu-bakar-1993-mumbai-blast-accused-held-in-uae-exclusive-1908945-2022-02-04","text":"Abu Bakar, one of India&apos;s most wanted terrorists and 1993 Mumbai blast accused, held in UAE"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/dawood-ibrahim-underworld-don-d-gang-173388-2013-08-10","text":"Dawood Ibrahim gang"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ed-mumbai-raids-dawood-ibrahim-money-laundering-case-1913106-2022-02-15","text":"ED raids Mumbai locations in money laundering case against Dawood Ibrahim"}],"loadedUrl":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/iqbal-kaskar-ed-custody-money-laundering-case-dawood-ibrahim-1914918-2022-02-18","publisher":"India Today","softTitle":"Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar sent to ED custody till Feb 24 in money laundering case","tags":[],"text":"By Divyesh Singh, Vidya : Iqbal Kaskar, brother of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim, who was brought to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office in Mumbai on Friday, has been sent to ED custody till February 24 in a money laundering case.\n\nThe ED had recently registered a money laundering case against underworld don and fugitive Dawood Ibrahim and his aides for their involvement in financing terror activities. The ED will question Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar, his aides and gang members.\n\nA special PMLA court approved a plea by the ED to take Iqbal Kaskar into custody.\n\nAssistant Director of ED, DC Nahak, while seeking the remand said that on Sept 18, 2017, Maharashtra police had registered a case of extortion against Kaskar, Israr Jamil Sayyad, Mumtaz Azaz Shaikh and others. The gang was accused of extorting money from a real estate builder and developer.\n\nIn 2015, a broker met the complainant builder along with Sayyad. Sayyad told him that he is the brother of underworld don Dawood and Kaskar. He also said that he had also bought the land from its owner and that the builder should go in for settlement. Sayyad even made the builder speak to Kaskar who threatened that if they did not agree then he would be killed.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the gang asked for four flats and Rs 30 lakh. When the building was ready, the builder did give him one flat but they wanted the rest too and started threatening him. The builder went to the police and Kaskar and others were arrested for extorting one flat and Rs 90 lakhs as protection money from the builder.\n\nKaskar was in judicial custody after being charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), following three cases of extortion.\n\nAdvocate Hiten Venegaonkar appearing for the central agency ED argued that the accused have committed the crime for their and gangs' financial benefit. Since there was extortion and so money laundering could be a possibility, so to investigate the case further, the ED registered a case, eight days later.\n\nVenegaonkar also said that Dawood's 'D-Company' and his associates have established a special unit for striking terror in the people by attacking eminent personalities including political leaders, businessmen and others by using explosives/firearms and other lethal weapons and is planning to instigate and trigger incidents which may lead to the onset of violence in various parts of India, including National Capital Region, Mumbai and other major cities in India.\n\nREAD | Abu Bakar, one of India's most wanted terrorists and 1993 Mumbai blast accused, held in UAE\n\nVenegaonkar added that NIA registered a case earlier this year against Dawood and others, including Shakil Shaikh Babu Moiddin alias Chotta Shakeel. In the chargesheet filed by Thane Police, Chhota Shakeel is also named, apart from Iqbal Kaskar.\n\n\"Both of them are termed as members of the same gang who used to do illegal activities for the financial benefit of the gang. In order to conduct an effective investigation against the Dawood gang as a whole, the ED is conducting investigation by considering the facts mentioned in both Thane Police and NIA cases,\" said Venegaonkar.\n\n\"Kaskar used his henchmen for this act and collected money on behalf of Dawood. The ED has evidence that Kaskar was regularly receiving substantial proceeds of crime from Dawood,\" argued Venegaonkar while adding that Kaskar has received a flat and Rs 90 lakh as extortion money which is proceeds of crime and is additionally regularly receiving money from Dawood also.\n\n\"Therefore, the said acquisition of proceeds of Crime generated from the act of extortion/other illegal activities make him guilty of offence of money laundering under section 3 of the PMLA,\" said Venegaonkar.\n\nKaskar was allegedly working for his brother and handling his gang activities and illegal business interests in Mumbai and other areas. Recently, it came to light that the Dawood Ibrahim gang was active in the country and were running terror activities, trying to disrupt law and order.\n\nEarlier this week, the ED had raided some 10 locations in Mumbai, including those related to Ibrahim's late sister Haseena Parkar, Kaskar as well as a brother-in-law of gangster Chota Shakeel.","title":"Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar sent to ED custody till Feb 24 in money laundering case","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vaW5kaWEvc3RvcnkvaXFiYWwta2Fza2FyLWVkLWN1c3RvZHktbW9uZXktbGF1bmRlcmluZy1jYXNlLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLTE5MTQ5MTgtMjAyMi0wMi0xONIBAA?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Arvind Ojha"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/gangster-ali-budesh-dies-due-to-illness-bahrain-1937630-2022-04-14","copyright":"2022 Living Media India Limited","date":"2022-04-14T17:47:00.000Z","description":"Bahrain-based gangster Ali Budesh has reportedly died due to illness.

The ED officials were investigating a case registered against Dawood Ibrahim, his brother Anees, Iqbal, aide Chota Shakeel and others.\n\nOne of the charges the ED is investigating against Malik \u2014  initially leveled by former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis \u2014 is a property deal that Malik had entered into. There are allegations that the property was allegedly bought by Malik from an aide of Dawood Ibrahim at a price lower than its prevailing market rate.\n\nDefiantly waving his fist in the air to the waiting media persons, Malik said he won't bow down. \"We will fight and win, and expose everyone,\" he said as he stepped out of the probe agency's office. He was then taken by ED officials in a vehicle for a medical check-up.\n\nMalik was grilled over alleged transactions with gangster Dawood's associates and land deals with them. He was evasive and didn't cooperate with the investigation, the ED said.\n\nLast week, raids were conducted at multiple locations across Mumbai, including the residence of Haseena Parkar -- sister of Dawood Ibrahim. Iqbal Kaskar, the fugitive's brother, was taken into custody last week while Haseena Parkar's son Alishah Parkar was questioned by the ED on Monday.\n\nKaskar's close aides booked in the extortion case also could be examined and their residences in Thane were also searched. One Salim Qureshi alias Salim Fruit, who is the brother-in-law of Dawood gangs top operative Chota Shakeel, is also under the scanner of the ED. He was questioned by the ED for nine hours and could be called again.\n\nThe 62-year-old Minister was taken to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office this morning for questioning. ED officials reached this home at 6 am where he was questioned for an hour. He was then brought to the ED office and questioned again for close to eight hours.\n\nWhile Malik was being questioned, NCP workers protested near the party's headquarters, located close to the ED office in south Mumbai, and shouted slogans slamming the BJP-led central government and the probe agency.\n\n\"The protest is against the unjust questioning of Nawab Malik as he was exposing the BJP+NCB+CBI+ED nexus on a daily basis. We will not be cowed down. NCP will keep exposing BJP and all central agencies,\" party spokesperson Sanjay Tatkare said.\n\nMalik had recently made headlines for attacking the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede accusing him of several service-related wrongdoings after the anti-drugs officer led the raid on a cruise ship on Mumbai's shore in October last year and arrested 20 people including superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan.\n\nReacting to the allegations against Malik, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said invoking Dawood was a convenient way to sully someone's reputation. \"I don't know about the case against him but Dawood's name has always been invoked to try to defame rivals,\" he said. Pawar claimed that he was also accused of having ties with the underworld when he was the state's Chief Minister.\n\n\"25 years later, the same trick is being used to harass and defame,\" he added. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and Sharad Pawar have accused the central agencies of being politically motivated and claimed that anyone who speaks against the Centre and its probe agencies is targeted.\n\nThe BJP has rubbished allegations of political vendetta and accused Malik of buying land from gangster Dawood Ibrahim's aide. BJP MLA from Mumbai's Ghatkopar West Ram Kadam also claimed that since the land was about to get seized by the government, the minister bought it at nominal rates from a bomb blast accused.\n\nFor more on news and current affairs from around the world, please visit Indiatimes News.","title":"Maharashtra Minister Arrested In Money Laundering Case Linked To Dawood Ibrahim","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvaW5kaWEvbmF3YWItbWFpbGstZWQtYXJyZXN0LW1vbmV5LWxhdW5kZXJpbmctY2FzZS01NjI4MTMuaHRtbNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2luZGlhL25hd2FiLW1haWxrLWVkLWFycmVzdC1tb25leS1sYXVuZGVyaW5nLWNhc2UtNTYyODEzLmh0bWw?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Jitendra Dixit"],"canonicalLink":"https://news.abplive.com/news/india/what-happens-after-you-win-dawood-ibrahim-s-seized-property-in-an-auction-1553838","copyright":"Copyright@2022.

But what you are not likely to get is the property itself, which you have become the lawful owner of after your triumph in the auction hall. Such has been the experience of a few people who imperilled themselves to bid for Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s properties and are now running from pillar to post to occupy them.\n\nMaharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis recently ordered the Maharashtra Police to come up with a list of properties owned by members of underworld gangs. In the past, several central agencies like the Income Tax Department and Smuggling and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Authority (SAFEMA) have made such lists of Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s gang. Based on these lists, auctions of Dawood\u2019s properties have been arranged from time to time. However, the story of those who bid for and win such properties is marred by threats and red-tape.\n\nAjay Shrivastava, a Delhi-based lawyer and former Shiv Sainik, was furious when he saw a TV report in 2000 that no bidders turned out for the auction of Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s property in south Mumbai\u2019s Hotel Diplomat. It was inferred that it was because of the fear Dawood\u2019s name invoked that nobody dared to bid for his property auctioned by the Income Tax department. Shrivastava appeared as the lone bidder in the next auctions held in 2001. He won two shops owned by Dawood\u2019s gang on Jairajbhai Lane of Nagpada. Shrivastava told the media that he participated in the auction to convey a message to Dawood that there are people in India who don\u2019t fear an anti-national like him. This followed a few alleged threat calls by the gang and the Delhi Police deployed armed guards for Shrivastava. His name was all over the news as somebody who took on the D-Company.\n\nIt has been over 20 years since the auction, but he could never get possession of the two shops. Once he went to inspect the property with the protection of the local police, but had to rush out because some people, allegedly Dawood\u2019s men, mobbed him. Although the property has been registered in his name, it continued to be occupied by Dawood\u2019s sister Haseena Parker. Shrivastava approached the Small Causes Court to get the possession, but the case dragged on for several years. Meanwhile, Haseena Parker died of a heart attack in July 2014. Shrivastava got the order in his favour nevertheless, but could not get hold of the property.\n\nA similar case is of Delhi-based businessman Piyush Jain. Looking at the limelight that Shrivastava got after bidding for Dawood\u2019s property, Jain and his brother too participated in the next auction and won two shops owned by the D-Company in the Nagpada area of Mumbai. Like Ajay Shrivastava, they too have been struggling to get possession of the shops. The property is yet to be registered in their names as the registrar\u2019s office has imposed a heavy penalty on them for delayed application for registration. They have legally challenged the penalty and are making rounds of courts in Mumbai.\n\nMeanwhile, Ajay Shrivastava participated in one more auction on Dawood\u2019s property by SAFEMA in November 2020.\n\nHe won Dawood\u2019s ancestral bungalow in the Mumbke village of Ratnagiri for Rs 11 lakh. However, he has still not occupied the property and the bungalow couldn\u2019t be transferred to his name as an incorrect plot number was reportedly submitted by governmental officers\u00a0during the auction. Now Shrivastava has to make rounds of Mumbai to get the error rectified. He intends to build a Sanatan Dharma Pathshala at Dawood\u2019s bungalow, and some local right-wing activists have contacted him for the same.","title":"What Happens After You Win Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s Seized Property In An Auction","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnBsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL3doYXQtaGFwcGVucy1hZnRlci15b3Utd2luLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLXMtc2VpemVkLXByb3BlcnR5LWluLWFuLWF1Y3Rpb24tMTU1MzgzONIBeWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnBsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL3doYXQtaGFwcGVucy1hZnRlci15b3Utd2luLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLXMtc2VpemVkLXByb3BlcnR5LWluLWFuLWF1Y3Rpb24tMTU1MzgzOC9hbXA?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":[],"canonicalLink":"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/prima-facie-evidence-that-nawab-malik-plotted-with-dawoods-d-company-court-2995919","copyright":"NDTV CONVERGENCE LIMITED 2023","date":"2022-05-21T13:28:33.000Z","description":"Nawab Malik case: A special court on Friday took cognisance of the Enforcement Directorate's chargesheet against NCP leader Nawab Malik and said there is evidence that the NCP leader directly was involved in criminal conspiracy along with D-Company.","favicon":"https://www.ndtv.com/images/icons/ndtv.ico","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/rqfrhvtg_nawab-malik-pti-650_625x300_08_March_22.jpg","keywords":"Nawab Malik,nawab malik dawood ibrahim case,Dawood Ibrahim,PMLA court Mumbai,Nawab Malik ED,D-company and Nawab malik,Nawab Malik allegations,Goawala compound kurla,D-gang,Nawab Malik Case","lang":null,"links":[],"loadedUrl":"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/prima-facie-evidence-that-nawab-malik-plotted-with-dawoods-d-company-court-2995919","publisher":"NDTV.com","softTitle":"Evidence Suggests NCP's Nawab Malik Plotted With Dawood Ibrahim: Court","tags":["Asian News International","Nawab Malik","nawab malik dawood ibrahim case","Nawab Malik Case"],"text":"A special court on Friday took cognisance of the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) chargesheet against Nationalist Congress Party's leader Nawab Malik and said there is prima facie evidence to indicate Mr Malik was directly and knowingly involved in the money laundering and criminal conspiracy with others to usurp Goawala compound in Kurla.\n\nThe court has issued a process against him and the 1993 bomb blast case accused Sardar Shahwali Khan, who is also named in the case.\n\nGiving a backgrounder about the said incident, the official order copy mentioned, \"An FIR dated February 3, 2022, was registered by NIA under section 120B of IPC and sections 17, 18, 20, 21, 38 and 40 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 against Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar and others. It is alleged that Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar, who has been designated as a global terrorist by the United Nations, runs an international terrorist network namely D Company, which is involved in various terrorist/criminal activities such as arms smuggling, narco-terrorism, underworld activities, money-laundering, circulation of FICN, unauthorized possession/acquisition of key assets for raising terror funds and is working in active collaboration with international terrorist organization including LeT, JeM and Al-Qaeda. In the said FIR, Anees Ibrahim Shaikh, Shakeel Shaikh, Javed Patel and Ibrahim Mushtaq Abdul Razzaq Memon are also arraigned as accused. On the basis of the aforesaid scheduled offence, Enforcement Directorate registered a case for investigation under PMLA, 2002 against them.\"\n\nEarlier, in the said matter, an FIR dated September 18, 2017, was registered at Kasarvadavli Police Station, Thane against Iqbal Kaskar, Mumtaz Shaikh and Israr Ali Jamil Sayyed for the offence of extortion under sections 384, 386 and 387 of IPC. Subsequently, Iqbal Kaskar, an associate of D Company and brother of Dawood Ibrahim and his associates, were also arrested under MCOCA and other sections. During the investigation, it is revealed that Hasina Parkar (dead) was one of the prominent members of D Company and sister and close associate of Dawood Ibrahim, the order read.\n\nThe order copy mentioned, \"It is alleged that accused Nawab Malik and members of D Company criminally conspired and had taken unauthorized possession/acquisition of the above property. It appears from the statements that Sardar Khan convicted in the Bombay Bomb Blast case was also part of the said conspiracy. In lieu of his assistance in usurping the property of Munira Plumber, he got a covered area of around 368 sq. mtr. in Goawala Compound and the same was given to him by Solidus Investments Pvt. Ltd. For usurping the above property, members of D-Company and accused Nawab Malik, connived together and executed several legal documents to put a facade of genuinity over the criminal act. To this end, Nawab Malik and Hasina Parkar entered into a criminal conspiracy and Nawab Malik agreed to pay Rs 55 lakhs to Hasina Parkar, Rs 1 lakhs to Salim Patel and Rs. 5 lakhs to Sardar Khan. Initially, Nawab Malik occupied Kurla General Store illegally using his clout and muscle power. He misguided the owner and took over the shed in Goawala Compound for acquiring M/s. Solidus Investments Pvt. Ltd.\"\n\nAfter the allegations were levelled against the accused and on perusal of various documents placed on record, it appeared to the Court that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding further with this case. \"I am of the opinion that process is required to be issued in this case against the accused arrayed in this complaint,\" Special Judge RN Rokade said.","title":"Evidence Suggests NCP's Nawab Malik Plotted With Dawood Ibrahim","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvcHJpbWEtZmFjaWUtZXZpZGVuY2UtdGhhdC1uYXdhYi1tYWxpay1wbG90dGVkLXdpdGgtZGF3b29kcy1kLWNvbXBhbnktY291cnQtMjk5NTkxOdIBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvcHJpbWEtZmFjaWUtZXZpZGVuY2UtdGhhdC1uYXdhYi1tYWxpay1wbG90dGVkLXdpdGgtZGF3b29kcy1kLWNvbXBhbnktY291cnQtMjk5NTkxOS9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["ANI"],"canonicalLink":"https://theprint.in/politics/issues-related-to-dawood-ibrahim-mumbai-riots-came-up-but-mva-government-was-indecisive-cm-shinde/1026800/","copyright":"2022 Printline Media Pvt","date":"2022-07-06T03:43:31.000Z","description":"Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], July 6 (ANI): Noting that there must be \u201cbig reason\u201d for 50 MLAs to leave a ruling alliance, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Wednesday said that the previous MVA government which had Congress and Shiv Sena as constituents could not take a decision when matters concerning Hindutva or Veer Savarkar or [\u2026]","image":null,"lang":"en","links":[],"loadedUrl":"https://theprint.in/politics/issues-related-to-dawood-ibrahim-mumbai-riots-came-up-but-mva-government-was-indecisive-cm-shinde/1026800/","publisher":"ThePrint","softTitle":"Issues related to Dawood Ibrahim, Mumbai riots came up but MVA government was indecisive: CM Shinde","tags":["ANI wire"],"text":"Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], July 6 (ANI): Noting that there must be \u201cbig reason\u201d for 50 MLAs to leave a ruling alliance, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Wednesday said that the previous MVA government which had Congress and Shiv Sena as constituents could not take a decision when matters concerning Hindutva or Veer Savarkar or that on Mumbai blasts and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim came up.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ANI, Shinde said they had decided to take further \u201cHindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray\u2019s ideology.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to take our Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray\u2019s Hindutva ideology, his role further. If 50 MLAs take such a step, then there must be a big reason for it. Nobody takes such a big decision for small reason. Even a corporator does not take such a decision. Why did 50 MLAs take such a decision? There was a need to think about this,\u201d Shinde said.\n\n\u201cShiv Sena, BJP contested 2019 assembly elections together but the government was formed with Congress, NCP. Due to this, whenever issues of Hindutva came up, matters relating to Savarkar came up, Mumbai blast issue came up, on Dawood issue came up and other issues when (these) came, we were unable to take a decision,\u201d he added.\n\nShinde was referring to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in February this year in connection with a money-laundering probe linked to the activities of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim and his aides.\n\nDawood Ibrahim is the main accused in the 1993 bomb blasts in Mumbai that killed 257 people. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had in May submitted a chargesheet against Malik in the money laundering case.\n\nShinde, who led a revolt in Shiv Sena leading to the resignation of Uddhav Thackeray as Chief Minister on June 29, had asked earlier how can Balasaheb Thackeray\u2019s Shiv Sena support people \u201cwho had a direct connection with culprits of Mumbai bomb blast, Dawood Ibrahim and those responsible for taking lives of innocent people of Mumbai\u201d.\n\nShinde had claimed the support of 50 MLAs including 40 of Shiv Sena.\n\nHe said that there was a revolt as Shiv Sena MLAs were facing challenges in their constituencies in terms of development work and NCP and Congress were encouraging their adversaries.\n\n\u201cThese 40-50 MLAs were facing challenges in their own constituencies as our alliance partners were strengthening those who were defeated. When we win elections, then voters expect development works including water, roads and other basic works, there were expectations but our MLAs were not able to do this due to deficiency of funds and other problems. We talked to our seniors many times that there should be corrective measures. But we could not succeed in this unfortunately. That\u2019s why our 40-50 MLAs took this decision,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the new government facing cases in courts and the battle over Shiv Sena likely to reach Election Commission, Shinde said they had not done anything illegal and followed the course of law.\n\n\u201cWe are not doing anything illegal. In the democracy of this country, there are rules, laws and the constitution and one has to work in accordance with it. Today, we have majority, we have more than two-thirds (of the legislative strength) of Shiv Sena and hence the decision we have taken is legal and valid. The Speaker has also recognised us. Those who moved the court against us were pulled up. We have not done anything illegal and those who did this, the court will decide against them. The floor test has been held, Speaker has been elected, the government has won the trust vote. Whatever is needed to be done in democracy has been done. This government has the support of 170 MLAs and it is a strong government.\u201d\n\nThe new Eknath Shinde-led government in Maharashtra won the floor test on Monday by a 164-99 margin.\n\nShinde said that his government will give justice to all sections of society and it will be a government of the people of the state.\n\n\u201cThis government will give justice to people. This is the government of the common people. This government will do justice to all sections of society including workers,\u201d he said. (ANI)\n\nThis report is auto-generated from ANI news service.

Kaskar is presently in judicial custody after being charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), following three cases of extortion registered against him by the Thane Police Crime Branch in 2017.\n\nED on Tuesday morning started conducting searches at various locations across Mumbai on elements related to Dawood Ibrahim.

Before arresting him, three teams of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) also raided his three bases. Raut was detained from his bungalow \u2018Maitri\u2019 and brought to the ED office and arrested after an 8-hour interrogation. Raut is a big name in Maharashtra politics today, but in the 80s he used to do crime reporting in Mumbai.\n\nSanjay Raut, who started his career with Lokprabha magazine, was considered an expert in underworld reporting. His reports on Dawood Ibrahim, Chhota Rajan, and the underworld were widely discussed in Mumbai. Raut\u2019s name grew in the world of reporting and he was noticed by Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray.\n\nRaut\u2019s visits to Matoshree increased and the Shiv Sena chief offered a 29-year-old Raut to become the executive editor of Shiv Sena mouthpiece \u2018Saamana\u2018. Raut could not turn down the offer of the Shiv Sena chief and he has been its executive editor for the past 30 years.\n\nHe came close to Uddhav Thackeray after Balasaheb\u2019s death in 2012. The way Uddhav formed the MVA government with Congress and NCP in 2019, Raut came to be called the \u2018think tank\u2019 of Shiv Sena.\n\nIt is said about Raut that despite being a crime reporter, he never went to the police and never met any police officer regarding any crime-related news. Dawood Ibrahim used to be the architect of underworld news of Raut, who did crime reporting. It is also said that Dawood Ibrahim used to visit Express Towers frequently to give the news to Sanjay Raut. Both used to sit and talk in the canteen here. This happened many years before Dawood\u2019s name cropped up in the 1993 Mumbai blasts.\n\nOn 16 January 2020, at an event in Pune, Sanjay Raut himself confessed that he had met Dawood. The Sena leader also claimed that he had once rebuked Dawood Ibrahim. \u201cI have seen him, I have met him, I have spoken to him and I have also admonished him,\u201d news agency PTI quoted him as saying.","title":"Considered Expert In Underworld Coverage, Sanjay Raut Once Chided Dawood Ibrahim","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhLmNvbS9tYWhhcmFzaHRyYS9jb25zaWRlcmVkLWV4cGVydC1pbi11bmRlcndvcmxkLWNvdmVyYWdlLXNhbmpheS1yYXV0LW9uY2UtY2hpZGVkLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLTU1NDczMTIv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWEuY29tL21haGFyYXNodHJhL2NvbnNpZGVyZWQtZXhwZXJ0LWluLXVuZGVyd29ybGQtY292ZXJhZ2Utc2FuamF5LXJhdXQtb25jZS1jaGlkZWQtZGF3b29kLWlicmFoaW0tNTU0NzMxMi9hbXAv?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Divyesh Singh"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/mumbai-crime-branch-arrests-dawood-ibrahims-arch-rival-amirzada-alamzeb-khan-in-land-grabbing-case-2302862-2022-11-28","copyright":"2022 Living Media India Limited","date":"2022-11-28T18:43:00.000Z","description":"Mumbai Crime Branch arrests Dawood Ibrahim's arch rival Amirzada, Alamzeb Khan in land grabbing case","favicon":"https://www.indiatoday.in/favicon.ico","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202211/dawoodibrahim_0-_3-four_three-four_three-four_three.jpeg?VersionId=EvreeiiHfPmDx9HCKfL1MPuXSrV.YLcN","keywords":"Mumbai Crime Branch arrests Dawood Ibrahim's arch rival Amirzada, Alamzeb Khan in land grabbing case ","lang":"en","links":[{"href":"/author/divyesh-singh","text":"<b>By Divyesh Singh</b>"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/dawood-ibrahim-close-aide-chhota-shakeel-forgery-case-1986320-2022-08-10","text":"Brother-in-law of Dawood Ibrahim&apos;s close aide Chhota Shakeel booked in forgery case"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/dawood-ibrahim-pakistan-karachi-974276-2017-04-29","text":" Dawood Ibrahim is 2nd richest gangster of all time; 10 things about most wanted global terrorist"},{"href":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/from-the-india-today-archives-1994-dawood-ibrahim-i-had-nothing-to-do-with-yakub-memon-never-seen-his-face-1999385-2022-09-12","text":"From India Today archives | Dawood Ibrahim: &#x201C;I had nothing to do with Yakub Memon, never seen his face&#x201D;"}],"loadedUrl":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/mumbai-crime-branch-arrests-dawood-ibrahims-arch-rival-amirzada-alamzeb-khan-in-land-grabbing-case-2302862-2022-11-28","publisher":"India Today","softTitle":"Kin of Dawood's once arch rival, who killed his brother, now works for his aide","tags":[],"text":"By Divyesh Singh: Fugitive gangster and global terror financer Dawood Ibrahim's rise in the world of crime was due to his brother Shabir being killed by the Pathan Gang in the year 1981.

There was no one to identify the extradited gangster as the person who had ordered the killing.\n\nThis is the fourth case registered against Rajan in Mumbai in which the gangster has been discharged by the court for want of evidence. Rajan had 71 cases registered against him in Mumbai. The CBI, which is prosecuting him in all these cases, has dropped 46 old cases for want of evidence and the courts had earlier discharged him in three other cases. The gangster is so far convicted in four cases, including that of journalist J Dey murder case, and acquitted him in five other cases.\n\nSharma, an alleged member of the Dawood Ibrahim gang, was one of the members of the group that was involved in shootout at JJ Hospital in 1991 to avenge the murder of Dawood\u2019s brother- in- law.\n\n\u201cIt is seen that the prosecution did not bring or collect any incriminating evidence against this applicant except the words allegedly uttered by the informant \u2013 Nana se Dushmani lene ka natija dekh (sic). Now, so as to connect the present applicant with the alleged words i.e. Nana, there is nothing to show that this applicant i.e. Chhota Rajan was referred as Nana,\u201d said the court while discharging Rajan from the case.\n\nAs per the prosecution, on September 9, 1999, Anilkumar Sharma, who was one of the accused in the infamous JJ Hospital shoot-out on September 12, 1990, allegedly carried out by the Dawood Ibrahim gang, was driving his Mahindra Jeep. When he reached Teli Galli Cross Lane at about 10.15am, suddenly, the accused overtook the jeep in their Maruti car and stopped it. The accused got down and fired at Sharma.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Sharma\u2019s murder was an outcome of the gang war. It was alleged that a squad of 24 sharpshooters from the Dawood Ibrahim gang, led by Subhashsingh Thakur, had ambushed ward no. 18 of JJ Hospital on September 22, 1992, to avenge the death of Dawood\u2019s brother-in-law Ibrahim Parkar by rival Arun Gawli gang.\n\nThe squad ended up killing Gawli\u2019s shooter Sailesh Haldankar and two police constables, who exchanged fire with the assailants. Sharma was alleged to be part of the squad formed to kill Haldankar.\n\nTo avenge Haldankar\u2019s murder, Rajan had allegedly instructed Ravi Pujari to eliminate members of the squad. Sharma was thus killed in the shoot-out as part of the gang war.\n\nRajan\u2019s lawyer Avinash Rasal, however, pointed out that the investigating officer of the case had failed to establish Rajan\u2019s identity as regards to the offence in question. He contended that there was not a single instance to show that Rajan had any talk with the deceased at any point of time or he had any grudge against Sharma.","title":"Chhota Rajan discharged by special court","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL211bWJhaS1uZXdzL2FuaWwtc2hhcm1hLW11cmRlci1jYXNlLWNoaG90YS1yYWphbi1kaXNjaGFyZ2VkLWJ5LXNwZWNpYWwtY291cnQtMTAxNjcxNTYxNDkzOTIwLmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2NpdGllcy9tdW1iYWktbmV3cy9hbmlsLXNoYXJtYS1tdXJkZXItY2FzZS1jaGhvdGEtcmFqYW4tZGlzY2hhcmdlZC1ieS1zcGVjaWFsLWNvdXJ0LTEwMTY3MTU2MTQ5MzkyMC1hbXAuaHRtbA?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["https://www.facebook.com/koimoidotcom","https://www.facebook.com/koimoidotcom","Koimoi.com Team"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/when-rishi-kapoor-recalled-dawood-ibrahims-men-catching-him-at-an-airport-getting-an-invitation-for-a-house-visit/","copyright":"Contests2win","date":"2022-02-27T08:43:43.000Z","description":"Veteran star Rishi Kapoor in his autobiography, Khullam Khulla had recalled his meeting with Dawood Ibrahim in an undisclosed location.","image":"https://static-koimoi.akamaized.net/wp-content/new-galleries/2022/02/when-rishi-kapoor-spoke-about-meeting-dawood-ibrahim-001.jpg","lang":"en","links":[{"href":"https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/from-bobby-karz-to-kabhi-kabhie-heres-a-brief-film-timeline-of-late-actor-rishi-kapoor/","text":"Khullam Khulla"},{"href":"https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/when-rishi-kapoor-threatened-shakun-batra-twice-of-quitting-kapoor-sons-not-a-single-day-passed-when-shakun-i-didnt-fight/","text":"Rishi Kapoor"},{"href":"https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/salman-khan-shakes-a-leg-with-disha-patani-on-his-da-bangg-tour-gets-brutally-trolled-bhai-aap-baap-lag-rahe/","text":"Salman Khan Shakes A Leg With Disha Patani On His Da-Bangg Tour; Gets Brutally Trolled, &#x201C;Bhai Aap Baap Lag Rahe&#x2026;&#x201D;"},{"href":"https://www.facebook.com/koimoidotcom","text":"Facebook"},{"href":"https://www.instagram.com/koimoi/","text":"Instagram"},{"href":"https://twitter.com/Koimoi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor","text":"Twitter"},{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/user/Koimoi4Bollywood","text":"Youtube"}],"loadedUrl":"https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/when-rishi-kapoor-recalled-dawood-ibrahims-men-catching-him-at-an-airport-getting-an-invitation-for-a-house-visit/","publisher":"Koimoi","softTitle":"When Rishi Kapoor Recalled Dawood Ibrahim's Men Catching Him At An Airport, Getting An Invitation For A House Visit","tags":["Asha Bhosle","Bittu Anand","Bollywood","D Day","Dawood Ibrahim","Entertainment News","Neetu Kapoor","RD Burman","Rishi Kapoor"],"text":"Veteran star Rishi Kapoor was known for sharing his blunt opinions on various topics, he even used to bash actors or filmmakers if he doesn\u2019t like a certain film. Meanwhile, the actor has played so many characters in his life, but his portrayal of Dawood Ibrahim in D-Day was applauded a lot. Back in 2017, the actor had released his autobiography, Khullam Khulla where he spoke about meeting the underworld gangster.\n\nKapoor even shared that he was taken to a private undisclosed location where he sat with India\u2019s most-wanted men and had a tea with him. He also recalled meeting him not once but twice in Dubai. The meeting happened in the year 1988, way before the 1993 Mumbai bomb blast.\n\nIn his autobiography, Khullam Khulla, Rishi Kapoor wrote, \u201cThe year was 1988. I had landed in Dubai with my closest friend, Bittu Anand, for an Asha Bhosle-RD Burman night. Dawood Ibrahim always had a man at the airport to keep him posted on VIP movement. When I was leaving the airport, a stranger walked up to me and handed me a phone. He said, \u2018Dawood sa\u2019ab baat karenge (Dawood sir would like to talk to you).\u2019\u201d\n\nRishi Kapoor added, \u201cObviously, this was before the 1993 blasts in Mumbai and I didn\u2019t think of Dawood Ibrahim as a fugitive on the run. He wasn\u2019t an enemy of the state yet. Or, at least, that was the impression I had. Dawood welcomed me and said, \u2018If there is anything you need, just let me know.\u2019 He also invited me to his house. I was taken aback.\u201d\n\nTalking about his second meeting in 1989 with wife Neetu Kapoor while they were shopping for shoes, the actor recalled Dawood entered the store with 10 bodyguards and asked Rishi to buy whatever he wants. He even told the Bobby star to contact him whenever he needs anything.\n\nRishi Kapoor further shared, \u201cFinally Dawood said, \u2018I am a fugitive because I will not get justice in India. There are a lot of people there who are against me. There are also many in India I have bought. I pay several politicians who are in my pocket.\u2019 I said to him, \u2018Dawood, please leave me out of all this, yaar.

He was caught in the UAE after 29 years of manhunt.\n\nDawood Ibrahim is the son of a police constable who was with the Mumbai police. He started his crime life with gang wars in the Dongri area of Mumbai. In Dongri, he got in touch with gang members of Haji Mastan and his gang war started. In the 1980s, he was first arrested for a robbery case and later his criminal records increased. Dawood became more powerful and dangerous due to the fights between the Haji and the Pathan gangs, comprised mostly of migrants from Afghanistan.","title":"ED raids Mumbai locations in money laundering case against Dawood Ibrahim","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vaW5kaWEvc3RvcnkvZWQtbXVtYmFpLXJhaWRzLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLW1vbmV5LWxhdW5kZXJpbmctY2FzZS0xOTEzMTA2LTIwMjItMDItMTXSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2FtcC9pbmRpYS9zdG9yeS9lZC1tdW1iYWktcmFpZHMtZGF3b29kLWlicmFoaW0tbW9uZXktbGF1bmRlcmluZy1jYXNlLTE5MTMxMDYtMjAyMi0wMi0xNQ?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":[],"canonicalLink":"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/supreme-court-denies-bail-to-dawood-ibrahims-nephew-in-extortion-case-2944358","copyright":"NDTV CONVERGENCE LIMITED 2023","date":"2022-05-04T08:31:28.000Z","description":"The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to grant bail to the nephew of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in a 2019 case registered against him for alleged threats issued to a builder under the law to curb organized crime.","favicon":"https://www.ndtv.com/images/icons/ndtv.ico","image":"https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-08/dawood-ibrahim_650x400_71471342895.jpg","keywords":"Dawood Ibrahim,Dawood Ibrahim Nephew,Dawood Ibrahim Nephew Extortion Case","lang":null,"links":[],"loadedUrl":"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/supreme-court-denies-bail-to-dawood-ibrahims-nephew-in-extortion-case-2944358","publisher":"NDTV.com","softTitle":"Supreme Court Denies Bail To Dawood Ibrahim's Nephew In Extortion Case","tags":["Asian News International","Dawood Ibrahim","Dawood Ibrahim Nephew","Dawood Ibrahim Nephew Extortion Case"],"text":"The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to grant bail to the nephew of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in a 2019 case registered against him for alleged threats issued to a builder under the law to curb organized crime - Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).\n\nA bench of Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna asked the trial court to frame charges in the case and allowed Dawood's nephew to apply for bail afresh thereafter.\n\nThe bench dismissed the appeal filed against the Bombay High Court December 2021 order which had rejected the bail plea of Mohammed Rizwan Iqbal Hasan Shaikh Ibrahim Kaskar.\n\n\"We see no reason to allow the applicant on bail at this stage.

From a Mumbai slum, he built his \u2018D Company\u2019 into the country\u2019s biggest and most feared mafia. Today he still remains at large\u2026\n\nIs there anybody on Earth more elusive than Dawood Ibrahim?\n\nThe Indian gangster turned-terrorist has been on the run for almost thirty years, and there\u2019s been little Delhi can do to reel him in. Dawood, head of the \u2018D Company\u2019 mafia he founded in the late 1970s, is an enigma-at-large.\n\nCops still hunt him, gossip rags guess his every move, and barflies whisper his name as if he was stood next to them.\n\nThey\u2019re not entirely wrong. Dawood hasn\u2019t lived in Mumbai since 1993 when 13 bombs he helped plant blew swathes of it to the ground, and killed 257 people. Then, he fled to neighbouring Pakistan. According to most sources, he\u2019s still there.\n\nBut D Company henchmen still run Mumbai, India\u2019s so-called \u201cMaximum City.\u201d They pimp and push, smuggle and skim. D Company goons slip vast shipments of contraband into the city, extort the stars of Bollywood, and fix cricket. He even backs militants in Kashmir and northern Nigeria.\n\nIn truth, D Company is more than a mafia. It\u2019s \u201ca transnational criminal organization, a terrorist group, and an economic actor,\u201d wrote one US academic. And it remains \u201cboth a national and regional security threat for South Asia.\u201d\n\nIt all started very differently. Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar was born in 1955 in Dongri, a poor, chaotic corner of central Mumbai, heavily Muslim in a Hindu-dominated city. Dongri was barely the size of two football pitches, but it had gang pedigree. Crooks hawked stolen goods at its Thieves\u2019 Bazaar, and the city\u2019s biggest dons\u2014 Karim Lala and Haji Mastan\u2014both cut their teeth in Dongri after the Second World War.\n\nDawood\u2019s father, Ibrahim, was a local police constable. But picking up a steady wage was never on the cards, and Dawood and his brother Shabir got involved in theft, robbery and fraud from an early age. Dawood was a meticulous planner with a quick temper. He got his break in 1974 aged just 19, when he jumped a courier for Haji Mastan, banking US$200,000 in the process.\n\nIbrahim senior marched the boys to a local police station but the chief, sensing an opportunity, told Dawood and Shabir to keep fighting Mastan. \u201cInstead of taking the law in your hands,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can do it with the law by your side.\u201d\n\nIt was a red rag to Dawood, ever the planner, and the young gangster kicked off a vicious war against Mastan and his allies. In 1981 assassins cornered Dawood and Shabir at a gas station. They killed Shabir but Dawood escaped.\n\nWithin three years all three assassins would be dead\u2014but the violence was too much for Mumbai\u2019s cops, and they indicted Dawood for murder. The don fled to Dubai, where he made fortunes in gold smuggling and hawala, an informal remittance still popular in some parts of the Middle East.\n\nHe called his home the White House\u2014as he did every residence owing to a fascination with the US presidency\u2014and hosted crime bosses and Bollywood stars.\n\nDawood left D Company\u2019s day-to-day to his lieutenant Chhota Rajan, and throughout the \u201980s it became India\u2019s biggest mafia by far.\n\n\u201cRight from Bollywood to horse racing to the share market, he aimed to spread his tentacles everywhere,\u201d wrote S. Hussain Zaidi, a chronicler of Dawood\u2019s underworld career. \u201cThere was to be no megabucks business that was not controlled by his cartel.\u201d\n\nBut things were about to change. In 1991 India\u2019s economy opened up, ending decades of hermetic socialism. Overnight, the black markets dons had controlled became legitimate. Japanese TVs, or Chinese radios, could be bought in a store down the street. Mumbai\u2019s docks were no longer its gangsters\u2019 back yard.\n\nThe city\u2019s police saw their chance. Hundreds of mobsters were gunned down in so-called \u201cencounters,\u201d where cops shot first and planted guns later. \u201cWe cleaned this place up,\u201d one former officer told me defiantly, last time I visited Mumbai. \u201cWe did whatever it took.\u201d\n\nIn 1991 D Company members held a shocking gun battle with police, all of which TV crews captured.\n\nA year later Dawood ordered a hit on a rival in broad daylight. Mumbaikars were repulsed at the violence. \u201cThis was not merely one gang taking revenge on the other, or extracting its pound of flesh,\u201d wrote Zaidi. \u201cIt was a daring daylight attack on the system itself. The killing and injuring of policemen was unheard of in Mumbai\u2019s chequered mafia history, and it seemed Mumbai was turning into another Sicily.\u201d\n\nIn 1992 Hindu nationalists choreographed the destruction of a 16th-century mosque in northern India. Ensuing riots left 2,000 mostly Muslims dead.\n\nAlmost half lay in Mumbai, the country\u2019s biggest religious melting pot. It was a sobering reminder of partition in 1947 when a retreating Britain hastily redrew communal lines, and two million died. The grisly episode lit Dawood\u2019s taste for revenge.\n\nOn Friday, March 12th the following year, 13 bombs ripped through political buildings like the Bombay Stock Exchange, Air India headquarters and the office of the Shiv Sena, the far-right party who\u2019d called for the mosque demolition. Mumbai\u2019s noir was hitherto dominated by gang warfare.\n\nNow, wrote a BBC journalist, \u201cDawood\u2019s gang had leapt beyond the violent protection of its commercial interests, and into a political vendetta wreaked indiscriminately against an entire city.\u201d\n\nDawood Ibrahim had brought Mumbai to its knees. D Company had become a terrorist outfit.\n\nThe FBI and Interpol placed the don on their most-wanted lists. Mumbaikars clamoured for his arrest.\n\nChhota Rajan, a Hindu, was repulsed by the attacks and took his slice of D Company\u2019s business to Kuala Lumpur. Dawood and other capos decamped to Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s biggest city.\n\nThere, in another White House, they laid low\u2014and lived under the protection of Pakistani authorities keen to keep a bargaining chip over their rival neighbour.\n\nDawood paid Pakistan its dues. He bailed out its Central Bank with a massive cash loan, and armed the Lashkar-e- Taiba, a militant group bent on wresting control of Kashmir back from India. He even gave cash to Boko Haram, the Islamist group in northern Nigeria.\n\nIn 2008 Lashkar gunmen carried out blasts and raids across Mumbai\u2014 including a four-day siege of its iconic Taj Mahal hotel\u2014killed 31 people. Dawood, insiders said, smuggled the men into India.\n\nIndia placed a $25 million reward on Dawood\u2019s head, and it seemed justice might be just around the corner. But he kept evading capture. D Company grew quieter, more clinical. It got deeper into gambling\u2014 especially over cricket, India\u2019s national obsession.\n\nIn 2008 the Indian Premier League was christened, a twenty-over tournament now worth almost US$$7 billion.\n\nIn 2013, India Today report revealed that Dawood\u2019s brother Anees ran a massive IPL betting ring, bribing star players and threatening others to throw games.

But despite the grave allegations, Nawab Malik is putting up a confident face. He is smiling to the cameras, showing \u2018I am safe\u2019 attitude, and overall seems confident that allegations against him will not be proved. Moreover, the Maharashtra govt and his party is also supporting him.\n\nWhile answers to many of such questions remain concealed, it is clear that the MVA led Maharashtra govt and the National Congress Party (NCP) is entirely supporting Malik and has no intentions to make him resign from the Ministry. The NCP toughened its stand yesterday in the case and cleared that Malik would continue to be the Minister.\n\nBJP\u2019s Chandrakant Patil and Devendra Fadnavis yesterday had demanded that Malik should resign on March 3, today as Maharahstra\u2019s Budget Session began and said that the party would not allow the legislature to function until Malik resigned. State NCP President and Minister Jayant Patil then affirmed that though Malik was being alleged of his involvement in the Dawood Ibrahim case, he would not leave his Ministerial position. \u201cNo resignation means no resignation\u201d, he stated.\n\nToday, yet again, Devendra Fadnavis launched a blistering attack on MVA led govt and stated that the state government was dedicated to terrorist and gangster Dawood Ibrahim. He added that the MVA was being sympathetic towards those who helped Dawood and his aides, convicted in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts.\n\nCondemning the decision to retain Nawab Malik as a minister in the govt, Fadnavis said, \u201cFor the first time in Maharashtra, a minister is behind bars but his resignation hasn\u2019t been taken. This government is coming together to save people who keep relations with Dawood. That\u2019s why we have started protests and we demand that his resignation be taken immediately,\u201d he added.\n\nFor the first time in Maharashtra, a minister (Nawab Malik) is behind bars but his resignation hasn\u2019t been taken. This is unexpected. He hasn\u2019t been jailed for a small matter, he\u2019s accused of dealing with family of Dawood Ibrahim: Devendra Fadnavis, LoP in Maharashtra Assembly pic.twitter.com/ZPZkIevJXa\u2014 ANI (@ANI) March 3, 2022\n\nThe allegations posed by the ED against Malik are serious but the approach of NCP and Malik seems to be informal and uninhibited in the case. The \u2018Malik saga\u2019 actually kicked off when the ED arrested him in the case pertaining to a PMLA instance related to elements linked to Dawood Ibrahim and the underworld. There were reports saying that Malik was involved in the Hawala transfers operated by Dawood Ibrahim.\n\nOn February 15, the ED had conducted multiple raids in South Mumbai in connection with a money laundering case against the underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and his aides. Close to 9 places in Mumbai and 1 in Thane had been raided including the residences of Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s late sister Haseena Parkar and brother Iqbal Kaskar.\n\nThe agency later took into custody Iqbal Kaskar on February 19 and presented him before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court. Also, the National Investigation Agency had said that Dawood Ibrahim was planning to launch terror attacks in India and that he was transferring funds through Hawala channels to provide financial help to all those involved in a planned attack. Nawab Malik\u2019s name appeared in the process of investigation after the intelligence inputs directed the agency to look into the Hawala transactions while probing a money laundering case against Ibrahim, Iqbal Mirchi, Chhota Shakeel, Parkar and Javed Chikna.\n\nMeanwhile, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis last week reiterated the linkages between Nawab Malik in a money-laundering probe linked to 1993 Mumbai blasts accused Dawood Ibrahim. He alleged that Malik had purchased land worth rupees crores for just Rs 30 lakhs from 1993 bomb blasts accused Sardar Shahwali Khan and Sardar Patel, an aide of Dawood\u2019s sister Haseena Parkar.\n\nEarlier in November 2021 also, Fadnavis had exposed Malik and said that he and his family had bought land parcels from people linked with the underworld. The ED in the investigation process happened to learn that Malik had actually purchased land worth Rs 3 crores in the year 2005 from Haseena Parkar at Rs 30 lakhs. The sale deed was deliberately made to look like the cost of the land was Rs 30 lakhs when the practical cost transacted was at Rs 85 lakhs. The market value of the land today is around Rs 300 crores.\n\nThe ED quizzed Nawab Malik for 7 to 8 hours on the day he was arrested, but to no avail. Later ED on March 1, issued summons to his son Faraz Malik as Nawab Malik did not cooperate to the investigation process. It was later found by the agency that Faraz Malik had a major role to play in the land deal. The ED while probing into the land transaction between Nawab Malik and Hassena Parker, found that Faraz Malik had paid the required amount in cash to satisfy the deal.\n\nNawab Malik had bought Kurla\u2019s Goawala Compound property at Rs 85 lakhs and had asked Faraz Malik to pay Rs 55 lakhs in cash to Saleem Ishaq Patel who was working as a driver of Haseena Parkar. According to the reports, Parkar had given power of attorney of the land to Patel who got the deal signed by Faraz Malik. Patel was later arrested in 2007 with Parkar in a land grabbing and fraud case but no action had been taken against Malik and his son. The property deal began in 2003 and was completed by 2007.\n\nIt is important to note that, Nawab Malik has not been cooperative throughout the investigation initiated by the agency. According to the reports, he was seen waving at the public and the media with an immorally confident smile. He had also complained of kidney problems immediately after he was arrested and was shifted to JJ Hospital for treatment. However, the ED brought him back to custody after getting discharged.\n\n#WATCH | Mumbai: NCP leader and Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik being brought out of Enforcement Directorate office, to be taken for medical examination.\n\nHe has been arrested by Enforcement Directorate in connection with Dawood Ibrahim money laundering case. pic.twitter.com/UMAVK5ZEVW\u2014 ANI (@ANI) February 23, 2022\n\nWhile the ED is tracing the other person involved, it has affirmed that Faraz Malik is one of the two persons who delivered Rs 55 lakhs in cash and Rs 5 lakh in a cheque to Parkar in 2005-06 for the Kurla land. Further, it becomes interesting to note that, NCP leader Sharad Pawar had specifically criticized the arrest of Nawab Malik and said that the case was being planned deliberately to harass people who have been outspoken against misuse of central agencies. Trying to give a religious angle to the situation, he had said that Malik was being targeted because he is a Muslim.\n\n\u201cIf there is a Muslim activist who is their opponent, it is their habit to link his name to Dawood. When I was the CM of Maharashtra, they had tried to link my name with Dawood as well. This is an attempt to harass those who are speaking against the misuse of central agencies,\u201d Pawar was quoted.\n\nAlso, AIMIM Chief Asaddudin Owaisi saw the arrest of Malik as an opportunity to further its Islamist politics. He alleged that Malik was arrested only because he was a Muslim. AIMIM MP from Maharashtra, Imtiaz Jaleel also extended support to Malik and said that nobody from the MVA alliance was actually concerned over the issue. He said that the current Deputy CM from NCP, Ajit Pawar who is accused of a massive Irrigation Scam is from NCP and he never went to jail. He reiterated that Muslims in this country cannot be linked to terrorism.\n\nPertinently, the serial blasts, which ripped through Mumbai on March 12, 1993 had killed around 300 people and injured over 1,400. Ninety-nine persons were convicted for the blasts under various sections of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act (TADA). Sharad Pawar who was Maharahstra\u2019s Chief Minister during the 1993 blasts series, had invented an extra bomb blast to promote \u2018secularism\u2019 and \u2018maintain harmony between Hindus and Muslims\u2019. While there were a total of 12 blasts in the Hindu dominated areas, Pawar on the govt radio channel had announced that there were 13 blasts and that the last one (imaginary) had affected a Muslim dominated area.\n\n22 years later, Sharad Pawar, speaking at an event during the 89th Marathi Literary Meet near Pune, Pawar admitted that he had invented a bomb blast because all actual ones had happened in Hindu areas and he feared there will be communal tension as \u2018that is what Pakistan wanted\u2019.\n\nSHOCKING- Sharad Pawar ADMITS that he \u201cDELIBERATELY MISLED\u201d people during 1993 b\u043embings. \u201cInstead of 11 b\u043embings I said 12- one in Masjid Bandar- a minority area- JUST TO SHOW that b\u043embings are not only in Hindu Areas but also in MusIim areas\u201d#SharadPawar pic.twitter.com/Damx7y4zNO\u2014 Rosy (@rose_k01) December 12, 2019\n\nThe case is under investigation by the ED who is tracing all the linkages of illegal money transfers, land purchases and involvement of NCP\u2019s Nawab Malik in the Dawood Ibrahim case. Whatever happens, it is clear by now that the NCP and the MVA led govt would stand strong behind Malik and that is what is probably accounting to Malik\u2019s safe play in the case.","title":"Decoding the links between Nawab Malik and Dawood Ibrahim","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9waW5kaWEuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvZGVjb2RpbmctdGhlLWxpbmtzLWJldHdlZW4tbmF3YWItbWFsaWstYW5kLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9waW5kaWEuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvZGVjb2RpbmctdGhlLWxpbmtzLWJldHdlZW4tbmF3YWItbWFsaWstYW5kLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltL2FtcC8?oc=5","videos":[{"height":"392","src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBDHK3w8zoI?feature=oembed","width":"696"}]},{"author":["Republic World"],"canonicalLink":"https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/dawood-ibrahims-close-aides-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-by-mumbai-court-articleshow.html","copyright":"2023 Republic","date":"2022-05-20T12:34:00.000Z","description":"A Mumbai court has sent two suspects in the D-company case involving Dawood Ibrahim and his associates, to 14-day judicial custody after NIA conducted raids.","favicon":"https://www.republicworld.com/assets/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/fud8kgg89yncqmae_1653049886.jpeg","keywords":"dawood ibrahim,mumbai,arif abubakar shaikh","lang":"en","links":[],"loadedUrl":"https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/dawood-ibrahims-close-aides-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-by-mumbai-court-articleshow.html","publisher":"Republic World","softTitle":"Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s close aides sent to 14-day judicial custody by Mumbai Court","tags":[],"text":"A\u00a0Mumbai court on\u00a0Friday sent arrested gangster Chhota Shakeel\u2019s brothers-in-law\u00a0and close associates Arif Abubakar Shaikh and\u00a0Shabbir Abubakar Shaikh, suspects in the D-company case involving Dawood Ibrahim and his associates, to 14-day judicial custody. This comes weeks after the National Investigation Agency (NIA)\u00a0conducted raids\u00a0on Dawood's associates\u00a0in over 12 locations in Mumbai.\u00a0Both the arrested associates have been involved in handling D-Company's illegal activities and terrorist financing in the western suburbs of Mumbai.\n\nOn May 13, NIA arrested\u00a0Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s closest aides after conducting multiple raids in Mumbai and its suburbs. The NIA began tightening the noose around the Dawood gang,\u00a0Arif Abubakar Shaikh and Shabbir Abubakar Shaikh. It is to be noted that Chhota Shakeel remains a key member of the infamous D-gang.\n\nEarlier,\u00a0\u00a0Republic TV had accessed details of the NIA FIR against Pakistan-based Dawood Ibrahim who is the mastermind of the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts which resulted in 257 deaths and left over 1,400 people\u00a0injured.\u00a0As per the FIR registered on February 3, Ibrahim has been accused of running an international terrorist network - D-Company - that is involved in a number of criminal activities.\u00a0It mentioned that Ibrahim controlled his criminal activities in India through his close associates.\n\nConsidered a key figure in the Hawala network that operates in the Indian subcontinent, Dawood Ibrahim is\u00a0also infamous for his alleged involvement in smuggling and gang wars. However, he gained notoriety when multiple blasts rocked Mumbai on March 12, 1993, killing 257 people and injuring more than 1400. Along with his close aides, he allegedly escaped to Pakistan around the same time. The prosecution accused him of being the mastermind of the blasts. Despite the Indian government\u2019s persistent efforts, Pakistan has stonewalled any chance of trying to reach Ibrahim.\n\nIn the meanwhile, he has been consistently linked to multiple terror organizations like the Lashkar-e-Taiba, which carried out several terror attacks in India over the years. One such prominent attack where Ibrahim has been accused of providing logistics is the 26/11 terror attack. However, the accusations against him go beyond terrorism and extend\u00a0to his involvement in\u00a0the international betting and match-fixing syndicate. This includes the 2000 match-fixing controversy and the 2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing scandal.","title":"Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s close aides sent to 14-day judicial custody by Mumbai Court","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXB1YmxpY3dvcmxkLmNvbS9pbmRpYS1uZXdzL2dlbmVyYWwtbmV3cy9kYXdvb2QtaWJyYWhpbXMtY2xvc2UtYWlkZXMtc2VudC10by0xNC1kYXktanVkaWNpYWwtY3VzdG9keS1ieS1tdW1iYWktY291cnQtYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cuaHRtbNIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXB1YmxpY3dvcmxkLmNvbS9hbXAvaW5kaWEtbmV3cy9nZW5lcmFsLW5ld3MvZGF3b29kLWlicmFoaW1zLWNsb3NlLWFpZGVzLXNlbnQtdG8tMTQtZGF5LWp1ZGljaWFsLWN1c3RvZHktYnktbXVtYmFpLWNvdXJ0LWFydGljbGVzaG93Lmh0bWw?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":[],"canonicalLink":"https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/pakistan-authorities-inadvertently-admit-presence-of-dawood-ibrahim-report20220131215751","copyright":"aninews","date":"2022-01-31T16:27:51.099Z","description":"Islamabad [Pakistan], January 31 (ANI): Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has accused non-resident Pakistani billionaire Farooq Zahoor of business connections with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, an indirect admission that runs contrary to claims made by the country's leadership.","image":"https://aniportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/media/details/Dawood_Ibrahim_jan31.asdas20220131150238.jpg","keywords":"Islamabad leadership, Federal Investigation Agency, FIA, Pakistani billionaire Farooq Zahoor, UAE, Dawood Ibrahim","lang":"en","links":[{"href":"/topic/federal-investigation-agency","text":"Federal Investigation Agency"},{"href":"/topic/fia","text":"FIA"},{"href":"/topic/pakistani-billionaire-farooq-zahoor","text":"Pakistani billionaire Farooq Zahoor"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"/topic/fia","text":"FIA"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"/topic/uae","text":"UAE"},{"href":"/topic/uae","text":"UAE"},{"href":"/topic/fia","text":"FIA"},{"href":"/topic/fia","text":"FIA"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"/topic/fia","text":"FIA"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"},{"href":"/topic/dawood-ibrahim","text":"Dawood Ibrahim"}],"loadedUrl":"https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/pakistan-authorities-inadvertently-admit-presence-of-dawood-ibrahim-report20220131215751/","publisher":"ANI News","softTitle":"Pakistan authorities inadvertently admit presence of Dawood Ibrahim: Report","tags":["Federal Investigation Agency","FIA","Pakistani billionaire Farooq Zahoor","Dawood Ibrahim","UAE","Islamabad leadership"],"text":"Islamabad [Pakistan], January 31 (ANI): Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has accused non-resident Pakistani billionaire Farooq Zahoor of business connections with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, an indirect admission that runs contrary to claims made by the country's leadership.\n\nSanaullah Abbasi, who is head of the country's FIA, has registered an FIR in the alleged abduction of Farooq Zahoor's daughters.

She became successful shortly after her 1993 debut movie, Tirangaa.\u00a0The underworld's impact on Bollywood, during this time, was noticeably greater. The underworld mafia used to invest a lot in Bollywood films.\n\nBollywood stars and gangsters have long been the subject of tabloid romance stories. According to the reports, Mamta was dating Chhota Rajan, a henchman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. However, Chhota Ranjan's departure from India ended their relationship.\n\nAfterwards, Mamta was at the peak of her career when she disappeared from the entertainment industry. According to the reports, Mamta got married to the drug mafia, Vicky Goswami. Moreover, in 2017, Mamta had hit\u00a0the headlines when a narcotics raid\u00a0led to the issuance of a non-bailable warrant against her and Vicky by the Thane Police, Mumbai.\n\nTalking about the warrant, Mamta had asserted at a pre-recorded conference that she did not own Rs. 2000 crore that the police were referring to.\u00a0Furthermore, she said that whatever she did owns was the product of her laborious savings from Bollywood movies that she had done previously.

She won the hearts of the audiences with her very first film. However, the actress gained attention due to her purported romance with the underworld don, Dawood Ibrahim.\n\nIn her professional life, Mandakini was flourishing. Her career, however, started to decline after one of her photos with Dawood Ibrahim went viral. Soon, the actress disappeared from the industry after the release of her 1996 film, Zordaar. Following her conversion to Buddhism, Mandakini married Dr. Kagyur T. Rinpoche Thakur, a monk, in 1990. She now runs Tibetan yoga classes and is a follower of the Dalai lama.

She recalled the incident and said:\n\n\"He stayed in touch with me after I came back to Mumbai. For about nine months, we spoke on the phone daily. I have no idea when we fell in love with each other. After that, I travelled to Dubai to meet him. There he revealed to me that his real name was Abu Salem. I had no idea who he was even then. He was kind, compassionate, and genuine. There was no need for me to go into any further details. You can't look beyond when you're in love. It was pure love from his side.\"\n\nThe Libson police detained Monica and Abu Salem in 2002, for entering Portugal using fake passports. They were sent back to India in 2005. After spending two years in jail, Monica was released on bail in 2007.\n\nThe daughter of renowned director K. Asif, Heena Kausar was an Indian actress of the 1970s.

Its members \u201care in unauthorised possession or are involved in acquisition of key assets for raising terror funds and working in active collaboration with international terrorist organisations, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Al-Qaeda\u201d.\n\nOn May 9, the NIA had conducted raids on 20 locations in Mumbai connected with Ibrahim and his close associates. The agency detained Salim Qureshi aka Salim Fruit, an associate of detained gangster Shakeel. As per a statement by the NIA, \u201cSeveral hawala operators and drug peddlers were associated with Ibrahim and the NIA had registered [a case] in this regard in February.\"\n\nThis is the same case under which Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik was arrested and is currently in jail. The NIA had registered an FIR on February 3, 2022 under criminal conspiracy and Sections 17 (punishment for raising funds for terrorist acts), 18 (punishment for conspiracy), 20 (punishment for being member of terrorist gang or organisation), 21 (punishment for holding proceeds of crime), 38 (offences relating to membership of a terrorist organisation) and 40 (offences of raising fund for a terrorist organisation) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.\n\nThe FIR named Ibrahim, Anees, Shakeel, Chikna and Menon. It mentions that Ibrahim left India and started controlling his criminal activities in India through his sister Haseena Parkar and others.","title":"NIA arrests two members of Dawood gang","url":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NpdGllcy9tdW1iYWkvbmlhLWNoaG90YS1zaGFrZWVsLWFpZGVzLWRhd29vZC1pYnJhaGltLWFycmVzdGVkL2FydGljbGU2NTQwOTg5MC5lY2XSAXVodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXRpZXMvbXVtYmFpL25pYS1jaGhvdGEtc2hha2VlbC1haWRlcy1kYXdvb2QtaWJyYWhpbS1hcnJlc3RlZC9hcnRpY2xlNjU0MDk4OTAuZWNlL2FtcC8?oc=5","videos":[]},{"author":["Prathyush Parasuraman"],"canonicalLink":"https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/counter-culture-all-that-glitters-dubai-bling-fetishises-a-culture-of-smoke-and-mirrors/article66288280.ece","copyright":"2023","date":"2022-12-29T04:45:00.000Z","description":"It fetishises a culture of smoke and mirrors.","favicon":"https://frontline.thehindu.com/favicon.ico","image":"https://fl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ripb71/article66288278.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Dubai%20Bling.jpg","keywords":"Dubai Bling,Netflix ,reality TV,The Crown,The Gilded Age,The White Lotus,Made in Heaven,Bombay Begums,Keeping up with the Kardashians ,Real Housewives,Selling Sunset ,Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives ,Bigg Boss,Lock Upp,voyeurism","lang":"en","links":[],"loadedUrl":"https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/counter-culture-all-that-glitters-dubai-bling-fetishises-a-culture-of-smoke-and-mirrors/article66288280.ece","publisher":null,"softTitle":"Why Netflix reality show \u2018Dubai Bling\u2019 is a voyeuristic ode to a post-global city","tags":[],"text":"One of the most poignant lessons I have learned growing up is that snaking up the ladder\u2014in age, capital, experience, honour, popularity, or sex appeal\u2014does not necessarily widen the scope of your freedom. As we grow, it is not so much that we become freer as we trade one kind of freedom for another. The rest of our lives are spent yearning for past freedoms while trying to explain\u2014to others, to ourselves\u2014what the trade-off was; that it was worth it. This is tied to the lovely illusion that our existence is naturally, incontestably bending towards something meaningful, fuller, richer, better. This capitalist utopia of eternal growth is grafted onto the way we sketch our life\u2019s trajectory. Where each day is an economic unit, one sedimenting upon another, a grand eternal crescendo, as opposed to a seamless, contextless meander.When we were young\u2014without capital or experience\u2014 we craned our necks towards the dreamy mirage of adulthood as a domain of untrammelled choice, a luxury, a vex-less bubble. I remember, as a child, staring at a handsome father in the supermarket carting his child around in the shopping cart, paying for things without the boy having to ask if he could have it, thinking how wonderful that life was. That image was a trap I am still trying to extricate myself from.\n\nThe mistaking of financial security as the ultimate form of freedom. Sometimes, at the end of the exhausted workday, alone, cooking, mentally listing the vegetables to be bought for the next meal, the coffee, the sugar, making sure the bills are paid, a sharp ringing plea crosses the mind. Is this all there is to it?\n\nThis lesson seems all the more ingrained in the latest cinematic genre, what film critic Anupama Chopra called \u201cposh people angst\u201d speaking of Zoya Akhtar\u2019s filmography, and what we are increasingly seeing on the smaller screen\u2014through shows like Succession, The Crown, The Gilded Age, TheWhite Lotus, Made in Heaven, and Bombay Begums. Stories of rich people agonising through life, their richness a cushion on which they weep, on which they can be eternally, glamorously vexed. But vexed, nonetheless.\n\nReality television, too, has thrown its ring into this fire, from Keeping up with the Kardashians to Real Housewives, from Selling Sunset to Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives to what I consider the most iconic, most blinkered pinnacle of this genre\u2014 Dubai Bling. Reality TV has always smelled of desperation, as something in which only those participated who needed to, from Roadies to the many million iterations of Bigg Boss, to the recent Lock Upp, where contestants were \u201clocked up\u201d in a fake jail waiting to be eliminated, that is, leave the jail. Becoming free was to lose.\n\nWhen comedian Munawar Faruqui, who was really jailed for a joke he did not crack, was announced as one of the participants of Lock Upp, anchored by the right-wing-poisoned Kangana Ranaut, people were disappointed, wondering why he would go on a show that not just fetishises the prison complex but is anchored by a spokesperson of everything he stands against. Some murmured that he might need the money; after all, a lot of his shows were being cancelled by the right wing. Yes, that made sense.\n\nBut surely the rich do not need to be desperate, wanting to, as writer Jia Tolentino notes, \u201c[enact] the various self-delusions of the emotionally immature: the dream that you are being closely watched, assessed, and categorised\u201d. False, clearly false. Money does not alter the DNA, it only gilds its loopy steps a little. Now, suddenly, you have the richest of the rich allowing cameras into their homes, allowing themselves to be filmed, willingly, enthusiastically.\n\nTo be clear, the two categories of participants are not exactly the same. The rich housewives have control over the final look of the show in a way Munawar does not in Lock Upp because of their proximity to the producer Karan Johar. Money allows you to produce shows where the camera is turned adoringly on you, like the recent documentary Harry & Meghan has shown. In some sense, this is what money allows: more editorial control over your life\u2019s representation. How does it matter though? At the end of the day, all you become is a meme on an Instagram account and that becomes the legacy of the show. The currency of popularity is still the same\u2014controversy.\n\nDubai Bling cranks this voyeuristic impulse up a notch, a shameless ode not just to a city but to a lifestyle built upon the active erasure of the very thing it fetishises\u2014its past, its \u201cculture\u201d. The United Arab Emirates, with the world\u2019s fastest roller coaster, the biggest man-made port, the largest mall, the tallest tower, underwater rooms dipping into the sea, enormous art museum, air-conditioned bus-stops, islands constructed by carting one billion cubic feet of sand and sculpting land out of the sea, is ultimately a culture of smoke and mirrors.\n\nHere is how architect and urbanist George Katodrytis describes the gluttony: \u201cDubai is a prototype of the new post-global city, which creates appetites rather than solves problems.\u201d The question is: what does this recursive, spiralling appetite mask?\n\nDo not forget this is the country that provided refuge to Dawood Ibrahim, that allowed smuggling to build its financial bedrock, where there is no demand for transparency, in fact an active refusal of it. I still remember, in the years I lived there, how the murmur of the Arab Spring was silently but mercilessly shut down. The horror stories of migrant workers whose passports are yanked away. \u201cIn many complex and surprising ways, Dubai actually earns its living from fear,\u201d Marxist writer Mike Davis notes.\n\nThen, there are the characters who populate Dubai Bling. One of the most fascinating aspects of the show is that through the multiple catfights that dot the season, the worst insult they bestow on one another is the word \u201cfake\u201d. The worst thing you can be in this world, the absolute dregs, is to pretend to be someone you are not. The fear of being fake, of being perceived as fake runs, and ruins, their lifestyle.\n\n\u201cTo be rich is not enough. To perform richness as effortlessly as possible is the goal.\u201d\n\nTo be rich is not enough. To perform richness as effortlessly as possible is the goal. This is where the distinction between old money and new money comes in, where the latter have progressed in pocket but still think in terms of limits.\n\nDubai Bling, then, looks at that trade-off I spoke of earlier\u2014what are the freedoms you are giving up, the dignities you are swapping as you grow in wealth. This is a question old wealth never had to contend with because they had never experienced anything else. Moneyed freedom is something they were born into. It is why a Diana found it so hard to walk into The Palace, why she found it bizarre that they referred to themselves not as a family but as a \u201csystem\u201d. She was giving up a freedom that her in-laws had never experienced.\n\nKeep in mind this is a world populated by characters who dress in the most extravagant haute couture outfits and buy emeralds worth millions of dollars after a fight with the husband. Their wealth is perverse in a city that Davis calls a \u201cdreamworld of conspicuous consumption\u2026 bursting with architectural steroids\u2026 apocalyptic luxuries\u201d. The phallic Burj Khalifa keeps appearing in the backdrop, to imply the wealth of the location, the finest example of scale overpowering beauty.\n\nThe show hints at internal anguish but quickly papers it over with glitter and diamonds. We are not shown the labour behind the scenes, the hours that go into make-up and hair, because that would break the illusion that these folks landed in the lap of television pre-designed into perfection. At first, they seem absurd, with their demands for synthetic abs and surrogate children and being flown down in helicopters for a date, but you realise these people are also totemic of \u201cpost-global\u201d aspirations.\n\nIn that sense, Dubai Bling is ideologically ambivalent, acknowledging the perverse wealth, allowing us to mock it, even as it frames it with this dream-like glow. To want the very thing you mock, to be unsure of why you are mocking something. Is it because you can never have it?\n\nLike The Crown, Dubai Bling is unsure of itself. These shows are designed as \u201cguilty pleasures\u201d but in themselves they are unable to answer the basic question about what that guilt is premised on. Is it in mocking others, is it in feeling better seeing the rich but undeserving participants, in yearning for the very thing we mock, or guilt about the hypocrisy? Gucci over gamcha any day, right? Oh, but what will our Marxist friends think?\n\nPrathyush Parasuraman is a writer and critic who writes across publications, both print and online.
